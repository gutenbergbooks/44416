<p>The following Collection consists of
Essays and Fugitiv Peeces, ritten at various times,
and on different occasions, az wil appeer by their
dates and subjects. Many of them were dictated
at the moment, by the impulse of impressions
made by important political events, and
abound with a correspondent warmth of expression.
This freedom of language wil be excused
by the frends of the revolution and of good
guvernment, who wil recollect the sensations
they hav experienced, amidst the anarky and
distraction which succeeded the cloze of the
war. On such occasions a riter wil naturally
giv himself up to hiz feelings, and hiz manner
of <i>riting</i> wil flow from hiz manner of <i>thinking</i>.</p>

<p>Most of thoze peeces, which hav appeered
before in periodical papers and Magazeens, were
published with fictitious signatures; for I very
erly discuvered, that altho the name of an old
and respectable karacter givs credit and consequence
to hiz ritings, yet the name of a yung
man iz often prejudicial to hiz performances.
By conceeling my name, the opinions of men
hav been prezerved from an undu bias arizing
from personal prejudices, the faults of the ritings
hav been detected, and their merit in public
estimation ascertained.</p>

of theze Essays by an indulgent public, induced

me to publish them in a volum, with such alterations
and emendations, az I had heerd suggested
by frends or indifferent reeders, together
with some manuscripts, that my own wishes led
me to hope might be useful.</p>

<p>During the course of ten or twelv yeers, I
hav been laboring to correct popular errors, and
to assist my yung brethren in the road to truth
and virtue; my publications for theze purposes
hav been numerous; much time haz been spent,
which I do not regret, and much censure incurred,
which my hart tells me I do not dezerv.
The influence of a yung writer cannot be so
powerful or extensiv az that of an established
karacter; but I hav ever thot a man's usefulness
depends more on <i>exertion</i> than on <i>talents</i>.
I am attached to America by berth, education
and habit; but abuv all, by a philosophical
view of her situation, and the superior advantages
she enjoys, for augmenting the sum of social
happiness.</p>

<p>I should hav added another volum, had not
recent experience convinced me, that few large
publications in this country wil pay a printer,
much less an author. Should the Essays here
presented to the public, proov undezerving of
notice, I shal, with cheerfulness, resign my other
papers to oblivion.</p>

<p>The reeder wil obzerv that the orthography
of the volum iz not uniform. The reezon iz,
that many of the essays hav been published before,
in the common orthography, and it would
hav been a laborious task to copy the whole, for
the sake of changing the spelling.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pgxi">[pg xi]</span>
In the essays, ritten within the last year, a
considerable change of spelling iz introduced
by way of experiment. This liberty waz taken
by the writers before the age of queen Elizabeth,
and to this we are indeted for the preference
of modern spelling over that of Gower
and Chaucer. The man who admits that the
change of <i>housbonde</i>, <i>mynde</i>, <i>ygone</i>, <i>moneth</i> into
<i>husband</i>, <i>mind</i>, <i>gone</i>, <i>month</i>, iz an improovment,
must acknowlege also the riting of <i>helth</i>, <i>breth</i>,
<i>rong</i>, <i>tung</i>, <i>munth</i>, to be an improovment.
There iz no alternativ. Every possible reezon
that could ever be offered for altering the spelling
of wurds, stil exists in full force; and if a
gradual reform should not be made in our language,
it wil proov that we are less under the
influence of reezon than our ancestors.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="invisible">T</span>he Education of youth is, in all
governments, an object of the first
consequence. The impressions received
in early life, usually form
the characters of individuals; a
union of which forms the general
character of a nation.</p>

<p>The mode of Education and the arts taught to
youth, have, in every nation, been adapted to its particular
stage of society or local circumstances.</p>

<p>In the martial ages of Greece, the principal study of
its Legislators was, to acquaint the young men with
the use of arms, to inspire them with an undaunted
courage, and to form in the hearts of both sexes, an
invincible attachment to their country. Such was the
effect of their regulations for these purposes, that the
very women of Sparta and Athens, would reproach
their own sons, for surviving their companions who
fell in the field of battle.</p>

<p>Among the warlike Scythians, every male was not
only taught to use arms for attack and defence; but
was obliged to sleep in the field, to carry heavy burthens,
and to climb rocks and precipices, in order to
habituate himself to hardships, fatigue and danger.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg002">[pg 002]</span>
In Persia, during the flourishing reign of the great
Cyrus, the Education of youth, according to Xenophon,
formed a principal branch of the regulations of
the empire. The young men were divided into classes,
each of which had some particular duties to perform,
for which they were qualified by previous instructions
and exercise.</p>

<p>While nations are in a barbarous state, they have
few wants, and consequently few arts. Their principal
objects are, defence and subsistence; the Education
of a savage therefore extends little farther, than to enable
him to use, with dexterity, a bow and a tomahawk.</p>

<p>But in the progress of manners and of arts, war
ceases to be the employment of whole nations; it becomes
the business of a few, who are paid for defending
their country. Artificial wants multiply the number
of occupations; and these require a great diversity in
the mode of Education. Every youth must be instructed
in the business by which he is to procure subsistence.
Even the civilities of behavior, in polished
society, become a science; a bow and a curtesy are
taught with as much care and precision, as the elements
of Mathematics. Education proceeds therefore, by
gradual advances, from simplicity to corruption. Its
first object, among rude nations, is safety; its next,
utility; it afterwards extends to convenience; and
among the opulent part of civilized nations, it is directed
principally to show and amusement.</p>

<p>In despotic states, Education, like religion, is made
subservient to government. In some of the vast empires
of Asia, children are always instructed in the occupation
of their parents; thus the same arts are always
continued in the same families. Such an institution
cramps genius, and limits the progress of national
improvement; at the same time it is an almost immoveable
barrier against the introduction of vice, luxury,
faction and changes in government. This is one
of the principal causes, which have operated in combining
numerous millions of the human race under
one form of government, and preserving national tranquillity
<span class="pb" id="Pg003">[pg 003]</span>
for incredible periods of time. The empire
of China, whose government was founded on the
patriarchical discipline, has not suffered a revolution
in laws, manners or language, for many thousand
years.</p>

<p>In the complicated systems of government which are
established among the civilized nations of Europe,
Education has less influence in forming a national
character; but there is no state, in which it has not
an inseparable connection with morals, and a consequential
influence upon the peace and happiness of
society.</p>

<p>Education is a subject which has been exhausted by
the ablest writers, both among the ancients and moderns.
I am not vain enough to suppose I can suggest
any new ideas upon so trite a theme as Education in
general; but perhaps the manner of conducting the
youth in America may be capable of some improvement.
Our constitutions of civil government are not
yet firmly established; our national character is not
yet formed; and it is an object of vast magnitude that
systems of Education should be adopted and pursued,
which may not only diffuse a knowlege of the sciences,
but may implant, in the minds of the American youth,
the principles of virtue and of liberty; and inspire
them with just and liberal ideas of government, and
with an inviolable attachment to their own country.
It now becomes every American to examin the modes
of Education in Europe, to see how far they are applicable
in this country, and whether it is not possible
to make some valuable alterations, adapted to our local
and political circumstances. Let us examin the subject
in two views. First, as it respects arts and sciences.
Secondly, as it is connected with morals and government.
In each of these articles, let us see what errors
may be found, and what improvements suggested, in
our present practice.</p>

<p>The first error that I would mention, is, a too general
attention to the dead languages, with a neglect of our
own.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg004">[pg 004]</span>
This practice proceeds probably from the common
use of the Greek and Roman tongues, before the English
was brought to perfection. There was a long period
of time, when these languages were almost the
only repositories of science in Europe. Men, who had
a taste for learning, were under a necessity of recurring
to the sources, the Greek and Roman authors. These
will ever be held in the highest estimation both for
stile and sentiment; but the most valuable of them
have English translations, which, if they do not contain
all the elegance, communicate all the ideas of the
originals. The English language, perhaps, at this
moment, is the repository of as much learning, as one
half the languages of Europe. In copiousness it exceeds
all modern tongues; and though inferior to the
Greek and French in softness and harmony, yet it exceeds
the French in variety; it almost equals the Greek
and Roman in energy, and falls very little short of any
language in the regularity of its construction.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" title="This remark is confined solely to its construction; in point of orthography, our language is intolerably irregular." class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In deliberating upon any plan of instruction, we
should be attentive to its future influence and probable
advantages. What advantage does a merchant, a mechanic,
a farmer, derive from an acquaintance with the
Greek and Roman tongues? It is true, the etymology
of words cannot be well understood, without a knowlege
of the original languages of which ours is composed.
But a very accurate knowlege of the meaning
of words and of the true construction of sentences, may
be obtained by the help of Dictionaries and good English
writers; and this is all that is necessary in the common
occupations of life. But suppose there is some
advantage to be derived from an acquaintance with the
dead languages, will this compensate for the loss of five
or perhaps seven years of valuable time? Life is short,
and every hour should be employed to good purposes.
If there are no studies of more consequence to boys,
than those of Latin and Greek, let these languages employ
their time; for idleness is the bane of youth.
<span class="pb" id="Pg005">[pg 005]</span>
But when we have an elegant and copious language of
our own, with innumerable writers upon ethics, geography,
history, commerce and government; subjects
immediately interesting to every man; how can a parent
be justified in keeping his son several years over
rules of Syntax, which he forgets when he shuts his
book; or which, if remembered, can be of little or no
use in any branch of business? This absurdity is the
subject of common complaint; men see and feel the
impropriety of the usual practice; and yet no arguments
that have hitherto been used, have been sufficient
to change the system; or to place an English school
on a footing with a Latin one, in point of reputation.</p>

<p>It is not my wish to discountenance totally the study
of the dead languages. On the other hand I should
urge a more close attention to them, among young men
who are designed for the learned professions. The
poets, the orators, the philosophers and the historians
of Greece and Rome, furnish the most excellent models
of Stile, and the richest treasures of Science. The
slight attention given to a few of these authors, in our
usual course of Education, is rather calculated to make
pedants than scholars; and the time employed in gaining
superficial knowlege is really wasted.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" title="In our colleges and universities, students read some of the ancient Poets and Orators; but the Historians, which are perhaps more valuable, are generally neglected. The student just begins to read Latin and Greek to advantage, then quits the study. Where is the seminary, in which the students read Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Polybius, Dionysius Halicarnasseus, Livy, Velleius, Paterculus and Tacitus? How superficial must be that learning, which is acquired in four years!..." class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
"A little learning is a dangerous thing,<br />
Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring."
</div></div>

<p>But my meaning is, that the dead languages are not
necessary for men of business, merchants, mechanics,
planters, &amp;c. nor of utility sufficient to indemnify them
for the expense of time and money which is requisite
to acquire a tolerable acquaintance with the Greek
and Roman authors. Merchants often have occasion
for a knowlege of some foreign living language, as,
the French, the Italian, the Spanish, or the German;
but men, whose business is wholly domestic, have little
or no use for any language but their own; much less,
for languages known only in books.</p>

<p>There is one very necessary use of the Latin language,
which will always prevent it from falling into
<span class="pb" id="Pg006">[pg 006]</span>
neglect; which is, that it serves as a common interpreter
among the learned of all nations and ages.
Epitaphs, inscriptions on monuments and medals,
treaties, &amp;c. designed for perpetuity, are written in
Latin, which is every where understood by the learned,
and being a dead language is liable to no change.</p>

<p>But the high estimation in which the learned languages
have been held, has discouraged a due attention
to our own. People find themselves able without
much study to write and speak the English intelligibly,
and thus have been led to think rules of no utility.
This opinion has produced various and arbitrary practices,
in the use of the language, even among men of
the most information and accuracy; and this diversity
has produced another opinion, both false and injurious
to the language, that there are no rules or principles
on which the pronunciation and construction can be
settled.</p>

<p>This neglect is so general, that there is scarcely an
institution to be found in the country, where the English
tongue is taught regularly, from its elements to its
true and elegant construction, in prose and verse. Perhaps
in most schools, boys are taught the definition of
the parts of speech, and a few hard names which they
do not understand, and which the teacher seldom attempts
to explain; this is called <i>learning grammar</i>.
This practice of learning questions and answers without
acquiring any ideas, has given rise to a common
remark, <i>that grammar is a dry study</i>; and so is every
other study which is prosecuted without improving the
head or the heart. The study of geography is equally
dry, when the subject is not understood. But when
grammar is taught by the help of visible objects; when
children perceive that differences of words arise from
differences in things, which they may learn at a very
early period of life, the study becomes entertaining, as
well as improving. In general, when a study of any
kind is tiresome to a person, it is a presumptive evidence
that he does not make any proficiency in knowlege,
and this is almost always the fault of the instructor.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg007">[pg 007]</span>
In a few instances perhaps the study of English is
thought an object of consequence; but here also there
is a great error in the common practice; for the study
of English is preceded by several years attention to
Latin and Greek. Nay, there are men, who contend
that the best way to become acquainted with English,
is to learn Latin first. Common sense may justly smile
at such an opinion; but experience proves it to be
false.</p>

<p>If language is to be taught mechanically, or by rote,
it is a matter of little consequence whether the rules
are in English, Latin or Greek: But if children are to
acquire <i>ideas</i>, it is certainly easier to obtain them in a
language which they understand, than in a foreign
tongue. The distinctions between the principal parts
of speech are founded in nature, and are within the capacity
of a school boy. These distinctions should be
explained in English, and when well understood, will
facilitate the acquisition of other languages. Without
some preparation of this kind, boys will often find a
foreign language extremely difficult, and sometimes be
discouraged. We often see young persons of both
sexes, puzzling their heads with French, when they
can hardly write two sentences of good English. They
plod on for some months with much fatigue, little improvement,
and less pleasure, and then relinquish the
attempt.</p>

<p>The principles of any science afford pleasure to the
student who comprehends them. In order to render
the study of language agreeable, the distinctions between
words should be illustrated by the differences in visible
objects. Examples should be presented to the senses,
which are the inlets of all our knowlege. That <i>nouns
are the names of things, and that adjectives express their
qualities</i>, are abstract definitions, which a boy may
repeat five years without comprehending the meaning.
But that <i>table</i> is the name of an article, and
<i>hard</i> or <i>square</i> is its property, is a distinction obvious
to the senses, and consequently within a child's
capacity.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg008">[pg 008]</span>
There is one general practice in schools, which I
censure with diffidence; not because I doubt the propriety
of the censure, but because it is opposed to deep
rooted prejudices: This practice is the use of the Bible
as a school book. There are two reasons why this
practice has so generally prevailed: The first is, that
families in the country are not generally supplied with
any other book: The second, an opinion that the reading
of the scriptures will impress, upon the minds of
youth, the important truths of religion and morality.
The first may be easily removed; and the purpose of
the last is counteracted by the practice itself.</p>

<p>If people design the doctrines of the Bible as a system
of religion, ought they to appropriate the book to purposes
foreign to this design? Will not a familiarity,
contracted by a careless disrespectful reading of the
sacred volume, weaken the influence of its precepts
upon the heart?</p>

<p>Let us attend to the effect of familiarity in other
things.</p>

<p>The rigid Puritans, who first settled the New England
States, often chose their burying ground in the
center of their settlements. Convenience might have
been a motive for the choice; but it is probable that
a stronger reason was, the influence which they supposed
the frequent burials and constant sight of the
tombs would have upon the lives of men. The choice,
however, for the latter purpose, was extremely injudicious;
for it may be laid down as a general rule,
that those who live in a constant view of death, will
become hardened to its terrors.</p>

<p>No person has less sensibility than the Surgeon,
who has been accustomed to the amputation of limbs.
No person thinks less of death, than the Soldier, who
has frequently walked over the carcasses of his
slain comrades; or the Sexton, who lives among the
tombs.</p>

<p>Objects that affect the mind strongly, whether the
sensations they excite are painful or pleasureable, always
lose their effect by a frequent repetition of their impressions.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" title="The veneration we have for a great character, ceases with an intimate acquaintance with the man. The same principle is observable in the body. High seasoned food, without frequent intervals of abstinence, loses its relish. On the other hand, objects that make slight impressions at first, acquire strength by repetition. An elegant simplicity in a building may not affect the mind with great pleasure at first light; but the pleasure will always increase with repeated examinations of the structure...." class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Pg009">[pg 009]</span>
Those parts of the scripture, therefore,
which are calculated to strike terror to the mind, lose
their influence by being too frequently brought into
view. The same objection will not apply to the history
and morality of the Bible; select passages of which
may be read in schools to great advantage. In some
countries, the common people are not permitted to
read the Bible at all: In ours, it is as common as a
newspaper, and in schools, is read with nearly the same
degree of respect. Both these practices appear to be
extremes. My wish is not to see the Bible excluded
from schools, but to see it used as a system of religion
and morality.</p>

<p>These remarks suggest another error which is often
committed in our inferior schools: I mean that of
putting boys into difficult sciences, while they are too
young to exercise their reason upon abstract subjects.
For example; boys are often put to the study of mathematics,
at the age of eight or ten years; and before
they can either read or write. In order to show the
impropriety of such a practice, it is necessary to repeat
what was just now observed, that our senses are the
avenues of knowlege. This fact proves that the most
natural course of Education is that which employs,
first the senses or powers of the body, or those faculties
of the mind which first acquire strength; and then
proceeds to those studies which depend on the power
of comparing and combining ideas. The art of writing
is mechanical and imitative; this may therefore
employ boys, as soon as their fingers have strength sufficient
<span class="pb" id="Pg010">[pg 010]</span>
to command a pen. A knowledge of letters
requires the exercise of a mental power, memory; but
this is coeval almost with the first operations of the human
mind; and with respect to objects of sense, is almost
perfect even in childhood. Children may therefore
be taught reading, as soon as their organs of speech
have acquired strength sufficient to articulate the sounds
of words.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" title="Great caution should be observed in teaching children to pronounce the letters of the alphabet. The labials are easily pronounced; thus the first words a child can speak are papa and mama. But there are some letters, particularly l and r, which are of difficult pronunciation, and children should not be pressed to speak words in which they occur. The difficulty may produce a habit of stammering." class="fnanchor">[4]</a> </p>

<p>But those sciences, a knowlege of which is acquired
principally by the reasoning faculties, should be postponed
to a more advanced period of life. In the course
of an English Education, mathematics should be perhaps
the last study of youth in schools. Years of valuable
time are sometimes thrown away, in a fruitless
application to sciences, the principles of which are
above the comprehension of the students.</p>

<p>There is no particular age, at which every boy is
qualified to enter upon mathematics to advantage.
The proper time can be best determined by the instructors,
who are acquainted with the different capacities
of their pupils.</p>

<p>Another error, which is frequent in America, is that
a master undertakes to teach many different branches
in the same school. In new settlements, where people
are poor, and live in scattered situations, the practice is
often unavoidable: But in populous towns, it must be
considered as a defective plan of Education. For suppose
the teacher to be equally master of all the branches
which he attempts to teach, which seldom happens,
yet his attention must be distracted with a multiplicity
of objects, and consequently painful to himself and not
useful to the pupils. Add to this the continual interruptions
which the students of one branch suffer from
those of another, which must retard the progress of the
<span class="pb" id="Pg011">[pg 011]</span>
whole school. It is a much more eligible plan to appropriate
an apartment to each branch of Education,
with a teacher who makes that branch his sole employment.
The principal academies in Europe and America
are on this plan, which both reason and experience
prove to be the most useful.</p>

<p>With respect to literary institutions of the first rank,
it appears to me that their local situations are an object
of importance. It is a subject of controversy, whether
a large city or a country village is the most eligible situation
for a college or university. But the arguments
in favor of the latter, appear to me decisive. Large
cities are always scenes of dissipation and amusement,
which have a tendency to corrupt the hearts of youth
and divert their minds from their literary pursuits.
Reason teaches this doctrine, and experience has uniformly
confirmed the truth of it.</p>

<p>Strict discipline is essential to the prosperity of a public
seminary of science; and this is established with
more facility, and supported with more uniformity, in
a small village, where there are no great objects of curiosity
to interrupt the studies of youth or to call their
attention from the orders of the society.</p>

<p>That the morals of young men, as well as their application
to science, depend much on retirement, will
be generally acknowleged; but it will be said also, that
the company in large towns will improve their manners.
The question then is, which shall be sacrificed; the advantage
of an <i>uncorrupted heart</i> and an <i>improved head</i>;
or of polished manners. But this question supposes
that the virtues of the heart and the polish of the gentleman
are incompatible with each other; which is by
no means true. The gentleman and the scholar are
often united in the same person. But both are not
formed by the same means. The improvement of the
head requires close application to books; the refinement
of manners rather attends some degree of dissipation,
or at least a relaxation of the mind. To preserve
the purity of the heart, it is sometimes necessary, and
always useful, to place a youth beyond the reach of bad
<span class="pb" id="Pg012">[pg 012]</span>
examples; whereas a general knowlege of the world,
of all kinds of company, is requisite to teach a universal
propriety of behavior.</p>

<p>But youth is the time to form both the head and the
heart. The understanding is indeed ever enlarging;
but the seeds of knowlege should be planted in the mind,
while it is young and susceptible; and if the mind is
not kept untainted in <i>youth</i>, there is little probability
that the moral character of the <i>man</i> will be unblemished.
A genteel address, on the other hand, <i>may</i> be acquired
at any time of life, and <i>must</i> be acquired, if ever,
by mingling with good company. But were the cultivation
of the understanding and of the heart, inconsistent
with genteel manners, still no rational person could
hesitate which to prefer. The goodness of a heart is
of infinitely more consequence to society, than an
elegance of manners; nor will any superficial accomplishments
repair the want of principle in the mind.
It is always better to be <i>vulgarly right</i>, than <i>politely
wrong</i>.</p>

<p>But if the amusements, dissipation and vicious examples
in populous cities render them improper places
for seats of learning; the monkish mode of sequestering
boys from other society, and confining them to the
apartments of a college, appears to me another fault.
The human mind is like a rich field, which, without
constant care, will ever be covered with a luxuriant
growth of weeds. It is extremely dangerous to suffer
young men to pass the most critical period of life, when
the passions are strong, the judgement weak, and the
heart susceptible and unsuspecting, in a situation where
there is not the least restraint upon their inclinations.
My own observations lead me to draw the veil of silence
over the ill effects of this practice. But it is to be wished
that youth might always be kept under the inspection
of age and superior wisdom; that literary institutions
might be so situated, that the students might live
in decent families, be subject, in some measure, to their
discipline, and ever under the control of those whom
they respect.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg013">[pg 013]</span>
Perhaps it may also be numbered among the errors
in our systems of Education, that, in all our universities
and colleges, the students are all restricted to the same
course of study, and by being classed, limited to the
same progress. Classing is necessary, but whether students
should not be removeable from the lower to the
higher classes, as a reward for their superior industry
and improvements, is submitted to those who know
the effect of emulation upon the human mind.</p>

<p>But young gentlemen are not all designed for the
same line of business, and why should they pursue the
same studies? Why should a merchant trouble himself
with the rules of Greek and Roman syntax, or a planter
puzzle his head with conic sections? Life is too short
to acquire, and the mind of man too feeble to contain,
the whole circle of sciences. The greatest genius on
earth, not even a Bacon, can be a perfect master of <i>every</i>
branch; but any moderate genius may, by suitable application,
be perfect in any <i>one</i> branch. By attempting
therefore to teach young gentlemen every thing, we
make the most of them mere smatterers in science. In
order to qualify persons to figure in any profession, it is
necessary that they should attend closely to those
branches of learning which lead to it.</p>

<p>There are some arts and sciences which are necessary
for every man. Every man should be able to speak
and write his native tongue with correctness; and have
some knowlege of mathematics. The rules of arithmetic
are indispensably requisite. But besides the learning
which is of common utility, lads should be directed
to pursue those branches which are connected more immediately
with the business for which they are destined.</p>

<p>It would be very useful for the farming part of the
community, to furnish country schools with some easy
system of practical husbandry. By repeatedly reading
some book of this kind, the mind would be stored with
ideas, which might not indeed be understood in youth,
but which would be called into practice in some subsequent
period of life. This would lead the mind to the
subject of agriculture, and pave the way for improvements.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg014">[pg 014]</span>
Young gentlemen, designed for the mercantile line,
after having learned to write and speak English correctly,
might attend to French, Italian, or such other living
language, as they will probably want in the course of
business. These languages should be learned early in
youth, while the organs are yet pliable; otherwise the
pronunciation will probably be imperfect. These
studies might be succeeded by some attention to chronology,
and a regular application to geography, mathematics,
history, the general regulations of commercial
nations, principles of advance in trade, of insurance,
and to the general principles of government.</p>

<p>It appears to me that such a course of Education,
which might be completed by the age of fifteen or sixteen,
would have a tendency to make better merchants
than the usual practice which confines boys to Lucian,
Ovid and Tully, till they are fourteen, and then turns
them into a store, without an idea of their business, or
one article of Education necessary for them, except perhaps
a knowlege of writing and figures.</p>

<p>Such a system of English Education is also much
preferable to a university Education, even with the usual
honors; for it might be finished so early as to leave
young persons time to serve a regular apprenticeship,
without which no person should enter upon business.
But by the time a university Education is completed,
young men commonly commence <i>gentlemen</i>; their age
and their pride will not suffer them to go thro the
drudgery of a compting house, and they enter upon
business without the requisite accomplishments. Indeed
it appears to me that what is now called a <i>liberal
Education</i>, disqualifies a man for business. Habits are
formed in youth and by practice; and as business is, in
some measure, mechanical, every person should be exercised
in his employment, in an early period of life,
that his habits may be formed by the time his apprenticeship
expires. An Education in a university interferes
with the forming of these habits; and perhaps
forms opposite habits; the mind may contract a fondness
for ease, for pleasure or for books, which no efforts
<span class="pb" id="Pg015">[pg 015]</span>
can overcome. An academic Education, which should
furnish the youth with some ideas of men and things,
and leave time for an apprenticeship, before the age of
twenty one years, would in my opinion, be the most
eligible for young men who are designed for activ employments.</p>

<p>The method pursued in our colleges is better calculated
to fit youth for the learned professions than for
business. But perhaps the period of study, required as
the condition of receiving the usual degrees, is too
short. Four years, with the most assiduous application,
are a short time to furnish the mind with the necessary
knowlege of the languages and of the several sciences.
It might perhaps have been a period sufficiently long
for an infant settlement, as America was, at the time
when most of our colleges were founded. But as the
country becomes populous, wealthy and respectable, it
may be worthy of consideration, whether the period of
academic life should not be extended to six or seven
years.</p>

<p>But the principal defect in our plan of Education in
America, is, the want of good teachers in the academies
and common schools. By good teachers I mean,
men of unblemished reputation, and possessed of abilities,
competent to their stations. That a man should
be master of what he undertakes to teach, is a point
that will not be disputed; and yet it is certain that abilities
are often dispensed with, either thro inattention
or fear of expense.</p>

<p>To those who employ ignorant men to instruct their
children, permit me to suggest one important idea: That
it is better for youth to have <i>no</i> Education, than to
have a bad one; for it is more difficult to eradicate
habits, than to impress new ideas. The tender shrub
is easily bent to any figure; but the tree, which has
acquired its full growth, resists all impressions.</p>

<p>Yet abilities are not the sole requisites. The instructors
of youth ought, of all men, to be the most
prudent, accomplished, agreeable and respectable.
What avail a man's parts, if, while he is the "wisest
<span class="pb" id="Pg016">[pg 016]</span>
and brightest," he is the "meanest of mankind?" The
pernicious effects of bad example on the <i>minds</i> of youth
will probably be acknowleged; but with a view to <i>improvement</i>,
it is indispensably necessary that the teachers
should possess good breeding and agreeable manners.
In order to give full effect to instructions, it is requisite
that they should proceed from a man who is loved and
respected. But a low bred clown, or morose tyrant,
can command neither love nor respect; and that pupil
who has no motive for application to books, but the
fear of a rod, will not make a scholar.</p>

<p>The rod is often necessary in school; especially after
the children have been accustomed to disobedience and
a licentious behavior at home. All government originates
in families, and if neglected there, it will hardly
exist in society; but the want of it must be supplied
by the rod in school, the penal laws of the state, and the
terrors of divine wrath from the pulpit. The government
both of families and schools should be absolute.
There should, in families, be no appeal from one parent
to another, with the prospect of pardon for offences.
The one should always vindicate, at least apparently,
the conduct of the other. In schools the master should
be absolute in command; for it is utterly impossible
for any man to support order and discipline among
children, who are indulged with an appeal to their parents.
A proper subordination in families would generally
supersede the necessity of severity in schools; and
a strict discipline in both is the best foundation of good
order in political society.</p>

<p>If parents should say, "we cannot give the instructors
of our children unlimited authority over them, for
it may be abused and our children injured;" I would
answer, they must not place them under the direction
of any man, in whose temper, judgement and abilities,
they do not repose perfect confidence. The teacher
should be, if such can be found, as judicious and reasonable
a man as the parent.</p>

<p>There can be little improvement in schools, without
strict subordination; there can be no subordination,
<span class="pb" id="Pg017">[pg 017]</span>
without principles of esteem and respect in the pupils;
and the pupils cannot esteem and respect a man who is
not in himself respectable, and who is not treated with
respect by their parents. It may be laid down as an
invariable maxim, that a person is not fit to superintend
the Education of children, who has not the qualifications
which will command the esteem and respect
of his pupils. This maxim is founded on a truth
which every person may have observed; that children
always <i>love</i> an <i>amiable</i> man, and always <i>esteem</i> a <i>respectable</i>
one. Men and women have their passions, which
often rule their judgement and their conduct. They
have their caprices, their interests and their prejudices,
which at times incline them to treat the most meritorious
characters with disrespect. But children, artless
and unsuspecting, resign their hearts to any person whose
manners are agreeable, and whose conduct is respectable.
Whenever, therefore, pupils cease to respect their
teacher, he should be instantly dismissed.</p>

<p>Respect for an instructor will often supply the place
of a rod of correction. The pupil's attachment will
lead him to close attention to his studies; he fears not
the <i>rod</i> so much as the <i>displeasure</i> of his teacher; he
waits for a smile, or dreads a frown; he receives his
instructions and copies his manners. This generous
principle, the fear of offending, will prompt youth to
exertions; and instead of severity on the one hand, and
of slavish fear, with reluctant obedience on the other,
mutual esteem, respect and confidence strew flowers in
the road to knowlege.</p>

<p>With respect to morals and civil society, the other
view in which I proposed to treat this subject, the effects
of Education are so certain and extensiv, that it
behooves every parent and guardian to be particularly
attentiv to the characters of the men, whose province
it is to form the minds of youth.</p>

<p>From a strange inversion of the order of nature, the
cause of which it is not necessary to unfold, the most
important business in civil society, is, in many parts of
America, committed to the most worthless characters.
<span class="pb" id="Pg018">[pg 018]</span>
The Education of youth, an employment of more consequence
than making laws and preaching the gospel,
because it lays the foundation on which both law and
gospel rest for success; this Education is sunk to a level
with the most menial services. In most instances we
find the higher seminaries of learning intrusted to men
of good characters, and possessed of the moral virtues
and social affections. But many of our inferior schools,
which, so far as the heart is concerned, are as important
as colleges, are kept by men of no breeding, and many
of them, by men infamous for the most detestable
vices.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" title="How different this practice from the manner of educating youth in Rome, during the flourishing ages of the republic!

minds for good men and useful citizens, are often found
to sleep away, in school, the fumes of a debauch, and to
stun the ears of their pupils with frequent blasphemy?
It is idle to suppress such truths; nay more, it is wicked.
The practice of employing low and vicious characters
to direct the studies of youth, is, in a high degree,
criminal; it is destructive of the order and peace of
society; it is treason against morals, and of course, against
government; it ought to be arraigned before the tribunal
of reason, and condemned by all intelligent beings. The
practice is so exceedingly absurd, that it is surprising it
could ever have prevailed among rational people. Parents
wish their children to be <i>well bred</i>, yet place them under
the care of <i>clowns</i>. They wish to secure their hearts
from <i>vicious principles</i> and <i>habits</i>, yet commit them to the
care of men of the most <i>profligate lives</i>. They wish to
have their children taught <i>obedience</i> and <i>respect</i> for superiors,
yet give them a master that both parents and
children <i>despise</i>. A practice so glaringly absurd and irrational
has no name in any language! Parents themselves
will not associate with the men, whose company
they <i>oblige</i> their children to keep, even in that most important
period, when habits are forming for life.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" title="The practice of employing low characters in schools is not novel--Ascham, preceptor to Queen Elizabeth, gives us the following account of the practice in his time. 'Pity it is that commonly more care is had; yea and that among very wise men, to find out rather a cunning man for their horse, than a cunning man for their children. They say, nay, in word; but they do so, in deed. For to one they will give a stipend of two hundred crowns, and loth to offer the other two hundred shillings...." class="fnanchor">[6]</a> </p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg020">[pg 020]</span>
Are parents and guardians ignorant, that children
always imitate those with whom they live or associate?
That a boy, bred in the woods, will be a savage?
That another, bred in the army, will have the manners
of a soldier? That a third, bred in a kitchen,
will speak the language, and possess the ideas, of servants?
And that a fourth, bred in genteel company,
will have the manners of a gentleman? We cannot
believe that many people are ignorant of these truths.
Their conduct therefore can be ascribed to nothing but
inattention or fear of expense. It is perhaps literally
true, that a wild life among savages is preferable to an
Education in a kitchen, or under a drunken tutor; for
savages would leave the mind uncorrupted with the
vices, which reign among slaves and the depraved part
of civilized nations. It is therefore a point of infinite
importance to society, that youth should not associate
with persons whose manners they ought not to imitate;
much less should they be doomed to pass the most susceptable
period of life, with clowns, profligates and
slaves.</p>

<p>There are people so ignorant of the constitution of
our natures, as to declare, that young people should
see vices and their consequences, that they may learn
<span class="pb" id="Pg021">[pg 021]</span>
to detest and shun them. Such reasoning is like that
of the novel writers, who attempt to defend their delineations
of abandoned characters; and that of stage
players, who would vindicate the obscene exhibitions
of a theater; but the reasoning is totally false.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" title="The fact related by Justin, of an ancient people, will apply universally. 'Tanto plus in illis proficit vitiorum ignoratio, quam in his cognitio virtutis.' An ignorance of vice has a better effect, than a knowlege of virtue." class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Vice
always spreads by being published; young people are
taught many vices by fiction, books or public exhibitions;
vices, which they never would have known, had
they never read such books or attended such public places.
Crimes of all kinds, vices, judicial trials necessarily
obscene, and infamous punishments, should, if possible,
be concealed from the young. An examination in a
court of justice may teach the tricks of a knave, the
arts of a thief, and the evasions of hackneyed offenders,
to a dozen young culprits, and even tempt those who
have never committed a crime, to make a trial of their
skill. A newspaper may spread crimes; by communicating
to a nation the knowlege of an ingenious trick
of villainy, which, had it been suppressed, might have
died with its first inventor. It is not true that the effects
of vice and crimes deter others from the practice;
except when rarely seen. On the other hand, frequent
exhibitions either cease to make any impressions
on the minds of spectators, or else reconcile them to a
course of life, which at first was disagreeable.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
"Vice is a monster of so frightful <ins class="corr" title="mein" id="C021">mien</ins>,<br />
As to be hated, needs but to be seen;<br />
Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,<br />

</div></div>

<p>For these reasons, children should keep the best of
company, that they might have before them the best
manners, the best breeding, and the best conversation.
Their minds should be kept untainted, till their reasoning
faculties have acquired strength, and the good principles
which may be planted in their minds, have taken
deep root. They will then be able to make a firm
<span class="pb" id="Pg022">[pg 022]</span>
and probably a successful resistance, against the attacks
of secret corruption and brazen libertinism.</p>

<p>Our legislators frame laws for the suppression of vice
and immorality; our divines thunder, from the pulpit,
the terrors of infinite wrath, against the vices that
stain the characters of men. And do laws and preaching
effect a reformation of manners? Experience
would not give a very favorable answer to this inquiry.
The reason is obvious; the attempts are directed to
the wrong objects. Laws can only check the public
effects of vicious principles; but can never reach the
principles themselves; and preaching is not very intelligible
to people, till they arrive at an age when their
principles are rooted, or their habits firmly established.
An attempt to eradicate old habits, is as absurd, as to
lop off the branches of a huge oak, in order to root it
out of a rich soil. The most that such clipping will
effect, is to prevent a further growth.</p>

<p>The only practicable method to reform mankind, is
to begin with children; to banish, if possible, from their
company, every low bred, drunken, immoral character.
Virtue and vice will not grow together in a great
degree, but they will grow where they are planted,
and when one has taken root, it is not easily supplanted
by the other. The great art of correcting mankind
therefore, consists in prepossessing the mind with good
principles.</p>

<p>For this reason society requires that the Education
of youth should be watched with the most scrupulous
attention. Education, in a great measure, forms the
moral characters of men, and morals are the basis of
government.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" title="Plus ibi boni mores valent, quam alibi bonÃ¦ leges. Tac. de Mor. Germ. 19." class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Education should therefore be the first
care of a Legislature; not merely the institution of schools,
but the furnishing of them with the best men for teachers.
A good system of Education should be the first
article in the code of political regulations; for it is
much easier to introduce and establish an effectual system
for preserving morals, than to correct, by penal
<span class="pb" id="Pg023">[pg 023]</span>
statutes, the ill effects of a bad system. I am so fully
persuaded of this, that I shall almost adore that great
man, who shall change our practice and opinions, and
make it respectable for the first and best men to superintend
the Education of youth.</p>

<p>Another defect in our schools, which, since the revolution,
is become inexcuseable, is the want of proper
books. The collections which are now used consist of
essays that respect foreign and ancient nations. The
minds of youth are perpetually led to the history of
Greece and Rome or to Great Britain; boys are constantly
repeating the declamations of Demosthenes and
Cicero, or debates upon some political question in the
British Parliment. These are excellent specimens of
good sense, polished stile and perfect oratory; but they
are not interesting to children. They cannot be very
useful, except to young gentlemen who want them as
models of reasoning and eloquence, in the pulpit or at
the bar.</p>

<p>But every child in America should be acquainted
with his own country. He should read books that
furnish him with ideas that will be useful to him in
life and practice. As soon as he opens his lips, he
should rehearse the history of his own country; he
should lisp the praise of liberty, and of those illustrious
heroes and statesmen, who have wrought a revolution
in her favor.</p>

<p>A selection of essays, respecting the settlement and
geography of America; the history of the late revolution
and of the most remarkable characters and events
that distinguished it, and a compendium of the principles
of the federal and provincial governments, should
be the principal school book in the United States.
These are interesting objects to every man; they call
home the minds of youth and fix them upon the interests
of their own country, and they assist in forming
attachments to it, as well as in enlarging the understanding.</p>

<p>"It is observed by the great Montesquieu, that the
laws of education ought to be relative to the principles
of the government."<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" title="Spirit of Laws. Book 4." class="fnanchor">[9]</a> </p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg024">[pg 024]</span>
In despotic governments, the people should have little
or no education, except what tends to inspire them
with a servile fear. Information is fatal to despotism.</p>

<p>In monarchies, education should be partial, and adapted
to the rank of each class of citizens. But "in
a republican government," says the same writer, "the
whole power of education is required." Here every
class of people should <i>know</i> and <i>love</i> the laws. This
knowlege should be diffused by means of schools and
newspapers; and an attachment to the laws may be
formed by early impressions upon the mind.</p>

<p>Two regulations are essential to the continuance of
republican governments: 1. Such a distribution of
lands and such principles of descent and alienation, as
shall give every citizen a power of acquiring what his
industry merits.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" title="The power of entailing real estates is repugnant to the spirit of our American governments." class="fnanchor">[10]</a> 2. Such a system of education as
gives every citizen an opportunity of acquiring knowlege
and fitting himself for places of trust. These are
fundamental articles; the <i>sine qua non</i> of the existence
of the American republics.</p>

<p>Hence the absurdity of our copying the manners and
adopting the institutions of Monarchies.</p>

<p>In several States, we find laws passed, establishing
provision for colleges and academies, where people of
property may educate their sons; but no provision is
made for instructing the poorer rank of people, even in
reading and writing. Yet in these same States, every
citizen who is worth a few shillings annually, is entitled
to vote for legislators.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" title="I have known instructions from the inhabitants of a county, two thirds of whom could not write their names. How competent must such men be to decide an important point in legislation!" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> This appears to me a most
glaring solecism in government. The constitutions
are <i>republican</i>, and the laws of education are <i>monarchical</i>.
The <i>former</i> extend civil rights to every honest
industrious man; the <i>latter</i> deprive a large proportion
of the citizens of a most valuable privilege.</p>

<p>In our American republics, where <ins class="corr" title="governments" id="C24">government</ins> is
<span class="pb" id="Pg025">[pg 025]</span>
in the hands of the people, knowlege should be universally
diffused by means of public schools. Of such
consequence is it to society, that the people who make
laws, should be well informed, that I conceive no Legislature
can be justified in neglecting proper establishments
for this purpose.</p>

<p>When I speak of a diffusion of knowlege, I do not
mean merely a knowlege of spelling books, and the
New Testament. An acquaintance with ethics, and
with the general principles of law, commerce, money
and government, is necessary for the yeomanry of a
republican state. This acquaintance they might obtain
by means of books calculated for schools, and
read by the children, during the winter months, and
by the circulation of public papers.</p>

<p>"In Rome it was the common exercise of boys at
school, to learn the laws of the twelve tables by heart,
as they did their poets and classic authors."<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" title="Middleton's life of Cicero, volume 1, page 14." class="fnanchor">[12]</a> What
an excellent practice this in a free government!</p>

<p>It is said, indeed by many, that our common people
are already too well informed. Strange paradox! The
truth is, they have too much knowlege and spirit to resign
their share in government, and are not sufficiently
informed to govern themselves in all cases of difficulty.</p>

<p>There are some acts of the American legislatures
which astonish men of information; and blunders in
legislation are frequently ascribed to bad intentions.
But if we examin the men who compose these legislatures,
we shall find that wrong measures generally proceed
from ignorance either in the men themselves, or
in their constituents. They often mistake their own
interest, because they do not foresee the remote consequences
of a measure.</p>

<p>It may be true that all men cannot be legislators;
but the more generally knowlege is diffused among the
substantial yeomanry, the more perfect will be the laws
of a republican state.</p>

<p>Every small district should be furnished with a school,
at least four months in a year; when boys are not otherwise
<span class="pb" id="Pg026">[pg 026]</span>
employed. This school should be kept by the
most reputable and well informed man in the district.
Here children should be taught the usual branches of
learning: submission to superiors and to laws; the
moral or social duties; the history and transactions of
their own country; the principles of liberty and government.
Here the rough manners of the wilderness
should be softened, and the principles of virtue and good
behaviour inculcated. The <i>virtues</i> of men are of
more consequence to society than their <i>abilities</i>; and
for this reason, the <i>heart</i> should be cultivated with more
assiduity than the <i>head</i>.</p>

<p>Such a general system of education is neither impracticable
nor difficult; and excepting the formation
of a federal government that shall be efficient and permanent,
it demands the first attention of American
patriots. Until such a system shall be adopted and
pursued; until the Statesman and Divine shall unite
their efforts in <i>forming</i> the human mind, rather than in
loping its excressences, after it has been neglected; until
Legislators discover that the only way to make good
citizens and subjects, is to nourish them from infancy;
and until parents shall be convinced that the <i>worst</i>
of men are not the proper teachers to make the <i>best</i>;
mankind cannot know to what a degree of perfection
society and government may be carried. America affords
the fairest opportunities for making the experiment,
and opens the most encouraging prospect of success.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" title="It is worthy of remark, that in proportion as laws are favorable to the equal rights of men, the number of crimes in a state is diminished; except where the human mind is debased by extreme servitude, or by superstition. In France, there are but few crimes; religion and the rigor of a military force prevent them; perhaps also, ignorance in the peasantry may be assigned as another reason...." class="fnanchor">[13]</a> </p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg027">[pg 027]</span>
In a system of education, that should embrace every
part of the community, the female sex claim no inconsiderable
share of our attention.</p>

<p>The women in America (to their honor it is mentioned)
are not generally above the care of educating
their own children. Their own education should
therefore enable them to implant in the tender mind,
such sentiments of virtue, propriety and dignity, as are
suited to the freedom of our governments. Children
should be treated as children, but as children that are,
in a future time, to be men and women. By treating
them as if they were always to remain children, we
very often see their childishness adhere to them, even
in middle life. The silly language called <i>baby talk</i>, in
which most persons are initiated in infancy, often breaks
out in discourse, at the age of forty, and makes a man
appear very ridiculous.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" title="It has been already observed that a child always imitates what he sees and hears: For this reason, he should hear no language which is not correct and decent. Every word spoken to a child, should be pronounced with clearness and propriety. Banish from children all diminutive words, all whining and all bad grammar. A boy of six years old may be taught to speak as correctly, as Cicero did before the Roman Senate." class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In the same manner, vulgar,
obscene and illiberal ideas, imbibed in a nursery or a
kitchen, often give a tincture to the conduct through
life. In order to prevent every evil bias, the ladies,
whose province it is to direct the inclinations of children
on their first appearance, and to choose their nurses,
should be possessed, not only of amiable manners, but
of just sentiments and enlarged understandings.</p>

<p>But the influence of women in forming the dispositions
<span class="pb" id="Pg028">[pg 028]</span>
of youth, is not the sole reason why their education
should be particularly guarded; their influence in
controling the manners of a nation, is another powerful
reason. Women, once abandoned, may be instrumental
in corrupting society; but such is the delicacy
of the sex, and such the restraints which custom imposes
upon them, that they are generally the last to be corrupted.
There are innumerable instances of men, who
have been restrained from a vicious life, and even of
very <ins class="corr" title="abandonded" id="C028">abandoned</ins> men, who have been reclaimed, by
their attachment to ladies of virtue. A fondness for
the company and conversation of ladies of character,
may be considered as a young man's best security against
the attractives of a dissipated life. A man who
is attached to <i>good</i> company, seldom frequents that
which is <i>bad</i>. For this reason, society requires that
females should be well educated, and extend their influence
as far as possible over the other sex.</p>

<p>But a distinction is to be made between a <i>good</i> education,
and a <i>showy</i> one; for an education, merely superficial,
is a proof of corruption of taste, and has a mischievous
influence on manners. The education of females,
like that of males, should be adapted to the principles
of the government, and correspond with the stage
of society. Education in Paris differs from that in
Petersburg, and the education of females in London
or Paris should not be a model for the Americans to
copy.</p>

<p>In all nations a <i>good</i> education, is that which renders
the ladies correct in their manners, respectable in their
families, and agreeable in society. That education is
always <i>wrong</i>, which raises a woman above the duties
of her station.</p>

<p>In America, female education should have for its
object what is <i>useful</i>. Young ladies should be taught
to speak and write their own language with purity and
elegance; an article in which they are often deficient.
The French language is not necessary for ladies. In
some cases it is convenient, but, in general, it may be
considered as an article of luxury. As an accomplishment,
<span class="pb" id="Pg029">[pg 029]</span>
it may be studied by those whose attention is not
employed about more important concerns.</p>

<p>Some knowlege of arithmetic is necessary for every
lady. Geography should never be neglected. Belles
Letters learning seems to correspond with the dispositions
of most females. A taste for Poetry and
fine writing should be cultivated; for we expect the
most delicate sentiments from the pens of that sex,
which is possessed of the finest feelings.</p>

<p>A course of reading can hardly be prescribed for all
ladies. But it should be remarked, that this sex cannot
be too well acquainted with the writers upon human
life and manners. The Spectator should fill the
first place in every lady's library. Other volumes of
periodical papers, tho inferior to the Spectator, should
be read; and some of the best histories.</p>

<p>With respect to novels, so much admired by the
young, and so generally condemned by the old, what
shall I say? Perhaps it may be said with truth, that
some of them are useful, many of them pernicious, and
most of them trifling. A hundred volumes of modern
novels may be read, without acquiring a new idea.
Some of them contain entertaining stories, and where
the descriptions are drawn from nature, and from characters
and events in themselves innocent, the perusal of
them may be harmless.</p>

<p>Were novels written with a view to exhibit only one
side of human nature, to paint the social virtues, the
world would condemn them as defective: But I should
think them more perfect. Young people, especially
females, should not see the vicious part of mankind.
At best novels may be considered as the toys of youth;
the rattle boxes of sixteen. The mechanic gets his
pence for his toys, and the novel writer, for his books;
and it would be happy for society, if the latter were in all
cases as innocent play things as the former.</p>

<p>In the large towns in America, music, drawing and
dancing, constitute a part of female education. They,
however, hold a subordinate rank; for my fair friends
will pardon me, when I declare, that no man ever marries
a woman for her performance on a harpsichord, or
<span class="pb" id="Pg030">[pg 030]</span>
her figure in a minuet. However ambitious a woman
may be to command admiration <i>abroad</i>, her real merit
is known only at <i>home</i>. Admiration is useless, when it
is not supported by domestic worth. But real honor
and permanent esteem, are always secured by those who
preside over their own families with dignity.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" title="Nothing can be more fatal to domestic happiness in America, than a taste for copying the luxurious manners and amusements of England and France. Dancing, drawing and music, are principal articles of education in those kingdoms; therefore every girl in America must pass two or three years at a boarding school, tho her father cannot give her a farthing when she marries. This ambition to educate females above their fortunes pervades every part of America...." class="fnanchor">[15]</a> </p>

<p>Before I quit this subject, I beg leave to make some
remarks on a practice which appears to be attended
with important consequences; I mean that of sending
boys to Europe for an education, or sending to Europe
for teachers. This was right before the revolution; at
<span class="pb" id="Pg031">[pg 031]</span>
least so far as national attachments where concerned;
but the propriety of it ceased with our political relation
to Great Britain.</p>

<p>In the first place, our honor as an independent nation
is concerned in the establishment of literary institutions,
adequate to all our own purposes; without sending our
youth abroad, or depending on other nations for books
and instructors. It is very little to the reputation of
America to have it said abroad, that after the heroic
atchievements of the late war, these independent people
are obliged to send to Europe for men and books to
teach their children A B C.</p>

<p>But in another point of view, a foreign education is
directly opposite to our political interests, and ought to
be discountenanced, if not prohibited.</p>

<p>Every person of common observation will grant, that
most men prefer the manners and the government of
that country where they are educated. Let ten American
youths be sent, each to a different European kingdom,
and live there from the age of twelve to twenty,
and each will give the preference to the country where
he has resided.</p>

<p>The period from twelve to twenty is the most important
in life. The impressions made before that period
are commonly effaced; those that are made during that
period <i>always</i> remain for many years; and <i>generally</i> thro
life.</p>

<p>Ninety nine persons of a hundred who pass that period
in England or France, will prefer the people, their manners,
their laws, and their government, to those of their
nativ country. Such attachments are injurious, both
to the happiness of the men, and to the political interests
of their own country. As to private happiness, it is
universally known how much pain a man suffers by a
change of habits in living. The customs of Europe
are and ought to be different from ours; but when a
man has been bred in one country, his attachments to its
manners make them, in a great measure, necessary to
his happiness. On changing his residence, he must therefore
break his former habits, which is always a painful
<span class="pb" id="Pg032">[pg 032]</span>
sacrifice; or the discordance between the manners of his
own country, and his habits, must give him incessant
uneasiness; or he must introduce, into a circle of his
friends, the manners in which he was educated. These
consequences may follow, and the last, which is inevitable,
is a public injury. The refinement of manners in
every country should keep pace exactly with the increase
of its wealth; and perhaps the greatest evil America
now feels is, an improvement of taste and manners
which its wealth cannot support.</p>

<p>A foreign education is the very source of this evil; it
gives young gentlemen of fortune a relish for manners
and amusements which are not suited to this country;
which however, when introduced by this class of people,
will always become fashionable.</p>

<p>But a corruption of manners is not the sole objection
to a foreign education: An attachment to a <i>foreign</i> government,
or rather a want of attachment to our <i>own</i>, is
the natural effect of a residence abroad, during the period
of youth. It is recorded of one of the Greek cities,
that in a treaty with their conquerors, it was required
that they should give a certain number of <i>male children</i>
as hostages for the fulfilment of their engagements.
The Greeks absolutely refused, on the principle that
these children would imbibe the ideas and embrace the
manners of foreigners, or lose their love for their own
country: But they offered the same number of <i>old</i> men,
without hesitation. This anecdote is full of good sense.
A man should always form his habits and attachments
in the country where he is to reside for life. When these
habits are formed, young men may travel without danger
of losing their patriotism. A boy who lives in
England from twelve to twenty, will be an <i>Englishman</i>
in his manners and his feelings; but let him remain at
home till he is twenty, and form his attachments, he
may then be several years abroad, and still be an <i>American</i>.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" title="Cicero was twenty eight years old when he left Italy to travel into Greece and Asia. 'He did not stir abroad,' says Dr. Middleton, 'till he had completed his education at home; for nothing can be more pernicious to a nation, than the necessity of a foreign one.'--Life of Cicero, vol. 1. p. 48. Dr. Moore makes a remark precisely in point. Speaking of a foreign education, proposed by a certain Lord, who objected to the public schools in England, he says,..." class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
There may be exceptions to this observation; but
<span class="pb" id="Pg033">[pg 033]</span>
living examples may be mentioned to prove the truth
of the general principle here advanced, respecting the
influence of habit.</p>

<p>It may be said that foreign universities furnish much
better opportunities of improvement in the sciences than
the American. This may be true, and yet will not
justify the practice of sending young lads from their own
country. There are some branches of science which
may be studied to much greater advantage in Europe
than in America, particularly chymistry. When these
are to be acquired, young gentlemen ought to spare no
pains to attend the best professors. It may, therefore,
be useful, in some cases, for students to cross the atlantic
to <i>complete</i> a course of studies; but it is not necessary for
them to go early in life, nor to continue a long time.
Such instances need not be frequent even now; and
the necessity for them will diminish in proportion to the
future advancement of literature in America.</p>

<p>It is, however, much questioned, whether, in the ordinary
course of study, a young man can enjoy greater
<span class="pb" id="Pg034">[pg 034]</span>
advantages in Europe than in America. Experience
inclines me to raise a doubt, whether the danger to
which a youth must be exposed among the sons of dissipation
abroad, will not turn the scale in favor of our
American colleges. Certain it is, that four fifths of the
great literary characters in America never crossed the

<p>But if our universities and schools are not so good as
the English or Scotch, it is the business of our rulers to
improve them, not to endow them merely; for endowments
alone will never make a flourishing seminary;
but to furnish them with professors of the first
abilities and most assiduous application, and with a complete
apparatus for establishing theories by experiments.
Nature has been profuse to the Americans, in genius,
and in the advantages of climate and soil. If this
country, therefore, should long be indebted to Europe
for opportunities of acquiring any branch of science in
perfection, it must be by means of a criminal neglect of
its inhabitants.</p>

<p>The difference in the nature of the American and
European governments, is another objection to a foreign
education. Men form modes of reasoning, or habits of
thinking on political subjects, in the country where
they are bred; these modes of reasoning may be founded
on fact in all countries; but the same principles will
not apply in all governments, because of the infinite
variety of national opinions and habits. Before a man
can be a good Legislator, he must be intimately acquainted
with the temper of the people to be governed.
No man can be thus acquainted with a people, without
residing amongst them and mingling with all companies.
For want of this acquaintance, a Turgot and a Price
may reason most absurdly upon the Constitutions of the
American states; and when any person has been long
accustomed to believe in the propriety or impropriety of
certain maxims or regulations of government, it is very
difficult to change his opinions, or to persuade him
to adapt his reasoning to new and different circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg035">[pg 035]</span>
One half the European Protestants will now contend
that the Roman Catholic religion is subversive of civil
government. Tradition, books, education, have concurred
to fix this belief in their minds; and they will
not resign their opinions, even in America, where some
of the highest civil offices are in the hands of Roman
Catholics.</p>

<p>It is therefore of infinite importance that those who
direct the councils of a nation, should be educated in
that nation. Not that they should restrict their personal
acquaintance to their own country, but their first ideas,
attachments and habits should be acquired in the country
which they are to govern and defend. When a
knowlege of their own country is obtained, and an attachment
to its laws and interests deeply fixed in their
hearts, then young gentlemen may travel with infinite
advantage and perfect safety. I wish not therefore to
discourage travelling, but, if possible, to render it more
useful to individuals and to the community. My meaning
is, that <i>men</i> should travel, and not <i>boys</i>.</p>

<p>It is time for the Americans to change their usual
route, and travel thro a country which they never think
of, or think beneeth their notice: I mean the United
States.</p>

<p>While these States were a part of the British Empire,
our interest, our feelings, were those of Englishmen;
our dependence led us to respect and imitate their manners,
and to look up to them for our opinions. We
little thought of any national interest in America; and
while our commerce and governments were in the hands
of our parent country, and we had no common interest,
we little thought of improving our acquaintance with
each other, or of removing prejudices, and reconciling
the discordant feelings of the inhabitants of different
Provinces. But independence and union render it necessary
that the citizens of different States should know
each others characters and circumstances; that all jealousies
should be removed; that mutual respect and
confidence should succeed, and a harmony of views and
interests be cultivated by a friendly intercourse.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg036">[pg 036]</span>
A tour thro the United States ought now to be considered
as a necessary part of a liberal education. Instead
of sending young gentlemen to Europe to view
curiosities and learn vices and follies, let them spend
twelve or eighteen months in examining the local situation
of the different States; the rivers, the soil, the
population, the improvements and commercial advantages
of the whole; with an attention to the spirit and
manners of the inhabitants, their laws, local customs
and institutions. Such a tour should at least precede a
tour to Europe; for nothing can be more ridiculous
than a man travelling in a foreign country for information,
when he can give no account of his own. When,
therefore, young gentlemen have finished an academic
education, let them travel thro America, and afterwards
to Europe, if their time and fortunes will permit. But
if they cannot make a tour thro both, that in America
is certainly to be preferred; for the people of America,
with all their information, are yet extremely ignorant
of the geography, policy and manners of their neighbouring
States. Except a few gentlemen whose public
employments in the army and in Congress, have extended
their knowlege of America, the people in this country,
even of the higher classes, have not so correct information
respecting the United States, as they have respecting
England or France. Such ignorance is not
only disgraceful, but is materially prejudicial to our political
friendship and federal operations.</p>

<p>Americans, unshackle your minds, and act like independent
beings. You have been children long enough,
subject to the control, and subservient to the interest
of a haughty parent. You have now an interest of your
own to augment and defend: You have an empire to
raise and support by your exertions, and a national character
to establish and extend by your wisdom and virtues.
To effect these great objects, it is necessary to
frame a liberal plan of policy, and build it on a broad
system of education. Before this system can be formed
and embraced, the Americans must <i>believe</i>, and <i>act</i> from
the belief, that it is dishonorable to waste life in mimicking
the follies of other nations and basking in the
sunshine of foreign glory.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="ralign"><small>NEW YORK, 1788.</small></span></p>
<p class="center"><big>PRINCIPLES of GOVERNMENT <i>and</i> COMMERCE.</big></p>

<p>All mankind are, by nature, free, and have a
right to enjoy life, liberty and property.</p>

<p>One person has no right to take from another his
life, health, peace, or good name; to take away or lessen
his freedom of thinking and acting, or to injure his
estate in the smallest degree.</p>

<p>A collection of individuals forms a <i>society</i>; and every
society must have <i>government</i>, to prevent one man
from hurting another, and to punish such as commit
crimes. Every person's safety requires that he should
submit to be governed; for if one man may do harm
without suffering punishment, every man has the same
right, and no person can be safe.</p>

<p>It is necessary therefore that there should be laws
to control every man. Laws should be made by consent
or concurrence of the greatest part of the society.</p>

<p>The whole body of people in society is the sovereign
power or state; which is called, the body politic. Every
man forms a part of this state, and so has a share
in the sovereignty; at the same time, as an individual,
he is a subject of the state.</p>

<p>When a society is large, the whole state cannot meet
together for the purpose of making laws; the people
therefore agree to appoint deputies, or representativs,
to act for them. When these agents are chosen and
met together, they represent the whole state, and act as
the sovereign power. The people resign their own authority
to their representativs; the acts of these deputies
are in effect the acts of the people; and the people
have no right to refuse obedience.</p>

<p>It is as wrong to refuse obedience to the laws made
by our <i>representativs</i>, as it would be to break laws made
<span class="pb" id="Pg039">[pg 039]</span>
by <i>ourselves</i>. If a law is bad and produces general harm,
the people may appoint new deputies to repeal it; but
while it is a law, it is the act and will of the sovereign
power, and ought to be obeyed.</p>

<p>The people in free governments, make their own
laws by agents or representativs, and appoint the executiv
officers. An executiv officer is armed with the authority
of the whole state and cannot be resisted. He
cannot do wrong, unless he goes beyond the bounds of
the laws.</p>

<p>An executiv officer can hardly be too arbitrary; for
if the laws are good, they should be strictly executed and
religiously obeyed: If they are bad, the people can alter
or repeal them; or if the officer goes beyond his powers,
he is accountable to those who appoint him. A neglect
of good and wholesome laws is the bane of society.</p>

<p>Judges and all executiv officers should be made as
much as possible, independent of the will of the people
at large. They should be chosen by the representativs
of the people and answerable to them only: For if they
are elected by the people, they are apt to be swayed by
fear and affection; they may dispense with the laws,
to favor their friends, or secure their office. Besides,
their election is apt to occasion party spirit, cabals, bribery
and public disorder. These are great evils in a
state, and defeat the purposes of government.</p>

<p>The people have a right to advise their representativs
in certain cases, in which they may be well informed.
But this right cannot often be exercised with
propriety or safety: Nor should their instructions be
binding on their representativs: For the people, most
of whom live remote from each other, cannot always
be acquainted with the general interest of the state;
they cannot know all the reasons and arguments which
may be offered for, or against a measure, by people in
distant parts of the state; they cannot tell at home,
how they <i>themselves</i> would think and act, in a general
assembly of <i>all</i> the citizens.</p>

<p>In this situation, if the people of a certain district,
bind their representativ to vote in a particular manner,
<span class="pb" id="Pg040">[pg 040]</span>
they may bind him to do <i>wrong</i>. They make up their
minds, upon a partial view of facts, and form a resolution,
which they themselves, on a fair state of all the
facts, in the general assembly, might see reasons to
change. There have been instances, in which these
binding, positiv instructions, have obliged a representativ
to give his vote, contrary to the conviction of his
own mind and what he thought the good of the state;
consequently his vote was a violation of his oath.</p>

<p>But the opinions of the people should, if possible, be
collected; for the general sense of a nation is commonly
right. When people are well informed, their general
opinion is perhaps always right. But they may be
uninformed or misinformed and consequently their measures
may be repugnant to their own interest. This is
often the case, with particular districts of people; and
hence the bad policy of giving binding instructions to
representativs. The sense of a nation is collected by
the opinions of people in particular districts; but as
some of these opinions may be wrong, a representativ
should be left with discretionary powers to act for the
good of the state.</p>

<p>Representativs are chosen by the inhabitants of certain
districts, because this is most convenient: But
when they act as lawgivers, they act for the whole state.
When a man is considering the propriety of a general
measure, he is not to be influenced by the interest of a
single district or part of a state; but by the collectiv interest
of the whole state. A good lawgiver will not ask
solely what is <i>my</i> interest, or the interest of <i>my</i> town or
constituents? but, what will promote the interest of
the community; '<i>what will produce the greatest possible
good, to the greatest number of people</i>?'</p>

<p>When a legislativ body makes <i>laws</i>, it acts for <i>itself</i>
only, and can alter or repeal the laws when they become
inconvenient. But when it makes <i>grants</i> or <i>contracts</i>,
it act as a party, and cannot take back its grant, or change
the nature of its contracts, without the consent of the
other party. A state has no more right to neglect or
refuse to fulfil its engagements, than an individual.
<span class="pb" id="Pg041">[pg 041]</span>
There may be an exception in the case of a grant, for
if a state has made a grant, which, contrary to its expectations,
clearly endangers the safety of the community,
it may resume that grant. The public safety is a
consideration superior to all others. But the danger
must be great and obvious; it must be generally seen
and felt, before the state can be justified in recalling its
grant. To take back a gift, or break a contract, for
small causes or slight inconveniencies, is a most wanton
abuse of power. Bargains, conveyances, and voluntary
grants, where two parties are concerned, are <i>sacred things</i>;
they are the supports of social confidence and security;
they ought not to be sported with, because one party is
stronger than the other; they should be religiously observed.</p>

<p>As the state has no right to break its own promises,
so it has no right to alter the promises of individuals.
When one man has engaged to pay his debt in wheat,
and his creditor expects the promise to be fulfiled, the
legislature has no right to say, the debt shall be paid in
flax or horses. Such an act saps all the supports of
good faith between man and man; it is the worst kind
of tyranny.</p>

<p>For this reason, all <i>tender laws</i>, which oblige a creditor
to take, for his debt, some article which he never
intended nor engaged to take, are highly <i>unjust</i> and <i>tyrannical</i>.
The intention of the contracting parties
should be strictly regarded; the state may enforce that
intention, but can never have a right to interfere and
defeat it. A legislature has no right to put a bargain on
any footing, but that on which the parties <i>have</i> placed
it or <i>are willing</i> to place it.</p>

<p>If a state is poor, and people owe more money than can
be procured, a legislature may perhaps go so far as to suspend
the collection of debts; or to ordain that a certain
part only of the debts shall be recoverable immediately,
and the payment of the remainder suspended. This
may ease the debtors; but can be justified in extreme
cases only, when the people are generally and greatly
involved.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg042">[pg 042]</span>
A people should not generally be in debt: The consumers
of goods should not get credit. Heavy and numerous
debts are great evils to a state. If the people
will giv and take extensiv credit, the state should check
their imprudence, by putting debts out of the protection
of law. When it becomes a practice to collect debts
by law, it is a proof of corruption and degeneracy among
the people. Laws and courts are necessary to settle
controverted points between man and man; but a man
should pay an acknowledged debt, not because there is a
law to oblige him, but because it is <i>just</i> and <i>honest</i>, and
because he has PROMISED to pay it.</p>

<p>Money, or a medium in trade, is necessary in all great
states; but <i>too much</i> is a greater evil than <i>too little</i>.
When people can get money without labor, they neglect
business and become idle, prodigal and vicious;
and when they have nothing but money, they are poor
indeed. Spain was ruined by its mines of gold and silver
in South America. That kingdom possessed all the
money in Europe, and yet was the <i>poorest</i>; it will never
be rich and flourishing, till its mines are exhausted.
The discovery of rich mines in this country, would be
the greatest misfortune, that can befall the United States.</p>

<p>Money is a mere representativ of property; it is the
<i>change</i> which facilitates trade. But the <i>wealth</i> of a country
is its <i>produce</i>; and its strength consists in the number
of its industrious inhabitants. A man cannot become
rich, unless he earns more than he spends. It is
the same with a country. The labouring men are the
support of a nation.</p>

<p>The value of money depends on the quantity in circulation.
A medium of trade respects all commercial
nations; and like water, it will find its level. Money
will go where it is wanted, if the people have any thing
to purchase it. If one state or country has more money
than another, it is a proof that the people are more industrious
or saving. It would be happy for the world, if
no more money could be made: There is already too
much. Silver is become very burdensome, merely because
there is too much in the world. If there were but
<span class="pb" id="Pg043">[pg 043]</span>
one quarter of the money which now circulates, one
quarter of a dollar would buy as much as a dollar will
now.</p>

<p>Hence the mistaken policy of those people who attempt
to increase the medium of trade by coinage or
by a paper currency. They can add to the quantity,
as much as they please; but not to the value. If America
were shut out from all intercourse with other nations,
and ten millions of dollars were circulating in the
country, every article of life would have a certain price.
If in this case, wheat should be one dollar a bushel, let
the money be instantly doubled, the price of wheat
would then be two dollars, and the price of every article
would rise in the same proportion. So that twenty
millions of dollars would be worth no more than ten,
because they would buy no more of the useful commodities:
America would be no richer in the one case
than in the other.</p>

<p>But as there is a communication with other nations,
a million of dollars, added to the circulating specie, does
not increase the permanent medium in quantity; for
just so much money as is added, will leave the country.
If there is too much money in a country, the price of
labor will rise, and the produce cannot find market
abroad without a loss. This was the case with American
produce, at the close of the war. If money is scarce
in a country, the price of labor will be low, and consequently
the produce of that country will be cheap at
home, and a great profit will be made on the exportation.
This profit will be returned, partly in goods and
partly in money, and the country is enriched.</p>

<p>But the great principle, which should constitute the
corner stone of government, is <i>public justice</i>. The fountain
head should be pure, or the streams will be foul
indeed. That Legislatures, or bodies politic, should
make laws, annex penalties for disobedience, institute
courts for deciding controversies and trying offenders,
and execute punishments on those that are convicted;
yet at the same time neglect to do justice themselves by
paying their own debts; this is of all absurdities the
<span class="pb" id="Pg044">[pg 044]</span>
most glaring. To compel individuals to perform contracts
and yet break their own solemn promises; to
punish individuals for neglect, and yet set a general example
of delinquency, is to undermine the foundation
of social confidence, and shake every principle of commutativ
justice.</p>

<p>These are general principles in government and trade,
and ought to be deeply impressed upon the minds of
every American.</p>

<h2><span class="pb" id="Pg045">[pg 045]</span>No. III.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<span class="ralign"><small>NEW YORK, 1788.</small></span></p>
<p class="center"><big>BILLS <i>of</i> RIGHTS.</big></p>

<p>One of the principal objections to the new Federal
Constitution, is, that it contains no <i>Bill of Rights</i>.
This objection, I presume to assert, is founded on ideas
of government that are totally false. Men seem determined
to adhere to old prejudices, and reason <i>wrong</i>, because
our ancestors reasoned <i>right</i>. A Bill of Rights
against the encroachments of Kings and Barons, or
against any power independent of the people, is perfectly
intelligible; but a Bill of Rights against the encroachments
of an electiv Legislature, that is, against our <i>own</i>
encroachments on <i>ourselves</i>, is a curiosity in government.</p>

<p>The English nation, from which we descended, have
been gaining their liberties, inch by inch, by forcing
concessions from the crown and the Barons, during the
course of six centuries.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" title="Not that the English nation was originally in slavery; for the primitiv Saxons and Germans were free. But the military tenures, established by the Gothic conquests, depressed the people; so that under the rigor of the feudal system, about the date of Magna Charta, the King and Nobles held their tenants in extreme servitude. From this depression, the English have gradually emerged into ancient freedom." class="fnanchor">[17]</a> <i>Magna Charta</i>, which is called
the palladium of English liberty, was dated in 1215,
and the people of England were not represented in Parliament
till the year 1265. Magna Charta established
the rights of the Barons and clergy against the encroachments
of royal perogativ; but the commons or people
were hardly noticed in that deed. There was
but one clause in their favor, which stipulated, that
"no villain or rustic should, by any fine, be bereaved of
his carts, plows and instruments of husbandry." As
for the rest, they were considered as a part of the property
belonging to an estate, and were transferred, as
other moveables, at the will of their owners. In the
succeeding reign, they were permitted to send Representativs
<span class="pb" id="Pg046">[pg 046]</span>
to Parliament; and from that time have been
gradually assuming their proper degree of consequence
in the British Legislature. In such a nation, every
law or statute that defines the powers of the crown, and
circumscribes them within determinate limits, must be
considered as a barrier to guard popular liberty. Every
acquisition of freedom must be established as a <i>right</i>, and
solemnly recognized by the supreme power of the nation;
lest it should be again resumed by the crown
under pretence of ancient prerogativ: For this reason,
the habeas corpus act passed in the reign of Charles 2d,
the statute of the 2d of William and Mary, and many
others which are declaratory of certain privileges, are
justly considered as the pillars of English freedom.</p>

<p>These statutes are however not esteemed because they
are unalterable; for the same power that enacted them,
can at any moment repeal them; but they are esteemed,
because they are barriers erected by the Representativs
of the nation, against a power that exists independent
of their own choice.</p>

<p>But the same reasons for such declaratory constitutions
do not exist in America, where the supreme power
is <i>the people in their Representativs</i>. The <i>Bills of Rights</i>,
prefixed to several of the constitutions of the United
States, if considered as assigning the reasons of our separation
from a foreign government, or as solemn declarations
of right against the encroachments of a foreign
jurisdiction, are perfectly rational, and were doubtless
necessary. But if they are considered as barriers
against the encroachments of our own Legislatures, or
as constitutions unalterable by posterity, I venture to
pronounce them nugatory, and to the last degree, absurd.</p>

<p>In our governments, there is no power of legislation,
independent of the people; no power that has an
interest detached from that of the public; consequently
there is no power existing against which it is necessary
to guard. While our Legislatures therefore remain
electiv, and the rulers have the same interest in the laws,
as the subjects have, the rights of the people will be
perfectly secure without any declaration in their favor.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg047">[pg 047]</span>
But this is not the principal point. I undertake to
prove that a standing <i>Bill of Rights</i> is <i>absurd</i>, because no
constitutions, in a free government, can be unalterable.
The present generation have indeed a right to declare
what <i>they</i> deem a <i>privilege</i>; but they have no right to
say what the <i>next</i> generation shall deem a privilege. A
state is a supreme <ins class="err" title="corporate" id="E047">corporate body</ins> that never dies. Its
powers, when it acts for itself, are at all times equally
extensiv; and it has the same right to <i>repeal</i> a law this
year, as it had to <i>make</i> it the last. If therefore our posterity
are bound by our constitutions, and can neither
amend nor annul them, they are to all intents and purposes
our slaves.</p>

<p>But it will be enquired, have we then no right to say,
that trial by jury, the liberty of the press, the habeas corpus
writ, and other invaluable privileges, shall never be
infringed nor destroyed? By no means. We have the
same right to say that lands shall descend in a particular
mode to the heirs of the deceased proprietor, and that
such a mode shall never be altered by future generations,
as we have to pass a law that the trial by jury shall
never be abridged. The right of Jury trial, which we
deem invaluable, may in future cease to be a privilege;
or other modes of trial more satisfactory to the people,
may be devised. Such an event is neither impossible
nor improbable. Have we then a right to say that our
posterity shall not be judges of their own circumstances?
The very attempt to make <i>perpetual</i> constitutions, is
the assumption of a right to control the opinions of future
generations; and to legislate for those over whom
we have as little authority as we have over a nation in
Asia. Nay we have as little right to say that trial by
jury shall be perpetual, as the English, in the reign of
Edward the Confessor, had, to bind their posterity forever
to decide causes by fiery Ordeal, or single combat.
There are perhaps many laws and regulations, which
from their consonance to the eternal rules of justice,
will always be good and conformable to the sense of a
nation. But most institutions in society, by reason of
an unceasing change of circumstances, either become
<span class="pb" id="Pg048">[pg 048]</span>
altogether improper, or require amendment; and every
nation has at all times, the right of judging of its circumstances
and determining on the propriety of changing
its laws.</p>

<p>The English writers talk much of the omnipotence of
Parliament; and yet they seem to entertain some scruples
about their right to change particular parts of their
constitution. I question much whether Parliament
would not hesitate to change, on any occasion, an article
of Magna Charta. Mr. Pitt, a few years ago, attempted
to reform the mode of representation in Parliament.
Immediately an uproar was raised against the measure,
as <i>unconstitutional</i>. The representation of the kingdom,
when first established, was doubtless equal and wise;
but by the increase of some cities and boroughs, and the
depopulation of others, it has become extremely <i>unequal</i>.
In some boroughs there is scarcely an elector left to enjoy
its privileges. If the nation feels no great inconvenience
from this change of circumstances, under the
old mode of representation, a reform is unnecessary. But
if such a change has produced any national evils of magnitude
enough to be felt, the present form of electing
the Representativs of the nation, however <i>constitutional</i>,
and venerable for its antiquity, may at any time be
amended, if it should be the sense of Parliament. The
<i>expediency</i> of the alteration must always be a matter of
opinion; but all scruples as to the right of making it
are totally groundless.</p>

<p>Magna Charta may be considered as a contract between
two parties, the King and the Barons, and no
contract can be altered but by the consent of both parties.
But whenever any article of that deed or contract
shall become inconvenient or oppressiv, the King, Lords
and Commons may either amend or annul it at pleasure.</p>

<p>The same reasoning applies to each of the United
States, and to the Federal Republic in general. But
an important question will arise from the foregoing remarks,
which must be the subject of another paper.</p>

<p>The important question I proposed to discuss in
this number, is this: "Whether, in a free State,
there ought to be any distinction between the powers of
the people, or electors, and the powers of the Representativs
in the Legislature." Or in other words, "whether
the legislativ body is not, or ought not to be, a standing
convention, invested with the whole power of their
constituents."</p>

<p>In supporting the affirmativ of this question, I must
face the opinions and prejudices of my countrymen;
yet if we attend closely to the merits of the question,
stripped of all its specious covering, we shall perhaps
find more arguments in favor of the opinion, than we
at first suspect.</p>

<p>In the first place, a Legislature must be the supreme
power, whose decisions are laws binding upon the whole
State. Unless the Legislature is the supreme power,
and invested with <i>all</i> the authority of the State, its acts
are not laws, obligatory upon the whole State.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" title="The first convention of deputies in a state, is usually designed to direct the mode in which future legislatures shall be organized. This convention cannot abridge the powers of future legislatures, any further than they are abridged by the moral law, which forbids all wrong in general." class="fnanchor">[18]</a> I am
sensible that it is a favorite idea in this country, bandied
about from one demagogue to another, that <i>rulers are
the servants of the people</i>. So far as their business is <i>laborious</i>
and <i>embarrassing</i>, it implies a degree of servitude;
but in any other view, the opinion is totally false. The
people ought at least to place their rulers, who are generally
men of the first abilities and integrity, on a level
with themselves; for that is an odd kind of government
indeed, in which, <i>servants</i> govern their <i>masters</i>.
<span class="pb" id="Pg050">[pg 050]</span>
The truth is, a Representativ, as an individual, is on a
footing with other people; as a Representativ of a
State, he is invested with a share of the sovereign authority,
and is so far a <i>governor</i> of the people. In short,
the collectiv body of the Representativs, is the collectiv
sense and authority of the people; and so far are the
members from being the <i>servants</i> of the people, that
they are just as much <i>masters</i>, <i>rulers</i>, <i>governors</i>, whatever
appellation we give them, as the people would be themselves
in a convention of the whole State.</p>

<p>But in the second place, the public good or safety requires
that the powers of a Legislature should be coextensiv
with those of the people. That a Legislature
should be competent to pass any law that the public
safety and interest may require, is a position that no man
will controvert. If therefore it can be proved that the
reservation of any power in the hands of the people,
may at times interfere with the power of the Legislature
to consult the public interest, and prevent its exercise,
it must be acknowleged, that such a reservation
is not only impolitic, but unjust. That a Legislature
should have unlimited power to do <i>right</i>, is unquestionable;
but such a power they cannot have, unless they
have all the power of the State; which implies an unlimited
power to do <i>wrong</i>. For instance, suppose the
constitution of any state to declare, that no standing
army shall be kept up in time of peace; then the Legislature
cannot raise and maintain a single soldier to
guard our frontiers, without violating the constitution.
To say that new enlistments every year will save the
constitution, is idle; for if a body of troops raised for
thirty years is a standing army, then a body raised for
twenty years, or for six months, is a standing army;
and the power to raise troops for a year, is a power to
raise them at any time and maintain them forever;
but with the addition of much trouble and a load of expense.
Since therefore there never was, and probably
never will be a time, till the millenium shall arrive,
when troops will not be necessary to guard the frontiers
of States, a clause in a constitution, restricting a Legislature
<span class="pb" id="Pg051">[pg 051]</span>
from maintaining troops in time of peace, will
unavoidably disable them from guarding the public interest.
That a power to raise and equip troops at pleasure,
may be abused, is certain; but that the public safety
cannot be established without that power, is equally
certain. The liberty of a people does not rest on any
reservation of power in their hands paramount to their
Legislature; it rests singly on this principle, <i>a union of
interests between the governors and governed</i>. While a
Legislator himself, his family and his property, are all
liable to the consequences of the laws which he makes
for the State, the rights of the people are as safe from
the invasion of power, as they can be on this side heaven.
This union of interest depends partly on the laws of
property; but mostly on the <i>freedom of election</i>. The
right of electing rulers is the people's prerogativ; and
while this remains unabridged, it is a sufficient barrier
to guard all their other rights. This prerogativ should
be kept sacred; and if the people ever suffer any abridgment
of this privilege, it must be their own folly and
an irrecoverable loss.</p>

<p>Still further, I maintain that a people have no right
to say, that any civil or political regulation shall be perpetual,
because they have no right to make laws for those
who are not in existence. This will be admitted; but
still the people contend that they have a right to prescribe
rules for their Legislature, rules which shall not
be changed but by the people in a convention. But
what is a convention? Why a body of men chosen by
the people in the manner they choose the members of
the Legislature, and commonly composed of the same
men; but at any rate they are neither wiser nor better.
The sense of the people is no better known in a convention,
than in the Legislature.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" title="The nominal distinction of Convention and Legislature was probably copied from the English; but the American distinction goes farther, it implies, in common acceptation, a difference of power. This difference does not exist in G. Britain. The assembly of Lords and Commons which restored Charles II, and that which raised the Prince of Orange to the throne, were called Conventions, or parliamentary Conventions...." class="fnanchor">[19]</a> </p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg052">[pg 052]</span>
But admit the right of establishing certain rules or
principles which an ordinary Legislature cannot change,
and what is the consequence? It is this, a change of
circumstances must supersede the propriety of such rules,
or render alterations necessary to the safety or freedom
of the State; yet there is no power existing, but in the
people at large, to make the necessary alterations. A
convention then must be called to transact a business,
which an ordinary Legislature can transact just as well;
a convention differing from the Legislature merely in
name, and in a few formalities of their proceedings.
But when people have enjoyed a tolerable share of happiness
under a government, they will not readily step
out of the common road of proceeding; and evils insensibly
increase to an enormous degree, before the people
can be persuaded to a change. The reservation therefore
of certain powers may, by an imperceptible change
of circumstances, prove highly pernicious to a State.
For example: When the Commons of England were
first admitted to a share in the legislation of that kingdom,
which was probably in the reign of Henry III, in
1265,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" title="This is the date of the first writs now extant, for summoning the Knights and Burgesses." class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the representation was tolerably equal. But the
<span class="pb" id="Pg053">[pg 053]</span>
changes in the population of different parts of the kingdom
have destroyed all equality. The mode of election
therefore should be reformed. But how shall it be
done? If there is a constitution in that kingdom, which
settles the mode of election, and that constitution is an
act of the people, paramount to the power of the Parliament,
and unchangeable by them, a convention of
the people must be called to make an alteration which
would be as well made in Parliament. This would
occasion infinite trouble and expense.</p>

<p>But the danger is, that as an evil of this kind increases,
so will the lethargy of the people, and their habits
of vice and negligence. Thus the disease acquires force,
for want of an early remedy, and a dissolution ensues.
But a Legislature, which is always watching the public
safety, will more early discover the approaches of disorders,
and more speedily apply a remedy. This is not
precisely the case with the British constitution; for it
was not committed at once to parchment and ratified
by the people. It consists rather of practice, or common
law, with some statutes of Parliament. But the
English have been too jealous of changing their practice,
even for the better. All the writers on the English
constitution agree, that any Parliament can change or
amend every part of it; yet in practice, the idea of an
<i>unalterable constitution</i> has had too much influence in
preventing a reform in their representation.</p>

<p>But we have an example nearer home directly in
point. The charter of Connecticut declares that each
town shall have liberty to send <i>one</i> or <i>two</i> deputies to
the General Court; and the constant practice has been
to send <i>two</i>. While the towns were few, the number of
Representativs was not inconvenient; but since the complete
settlement of the State, and the multiplication of
the towns, the number has swelled the Legislature to
an unwieldly and expensive size. The house of Representativs
consists of about 170 members: An attempt
has been made, at several sessions, to lessen the representation,
by limiting each town to one Deputy. A
question arises, have the Assembly a right to lessen the
<span class="pb" id="Pg054">[pg 054]</span>
representation? In most States, it would be decided in
the negativ. Yet in that State it is no question at all;
for there is a standing law expressly delegating the <i>whole</i>
power of all the freemen to the Legislature. But I
bring this instance to prove the possibility of changes in
any system of government, which will require material
alterations in its fundamental principles; and the Legislature
should always be competent to make the necessary
amendments, or they have not an unlimited power
to do right.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" title="In Pensylvania, after the late choice of Delegates to Congress by the people, one of the Gentlemen sent his resignation to the President and Council, who refered it to the Legislature then sitting. This body, compozed of the servants of the people, I suppoze, solemnly resolved, that there was no power in the State which could accept the resignation. The resolv was grounded on the idea that the power of the people is paramount to that of the Legislature;..." class="fnanchor">[21]</a> </p>

<p>The distinction between the <i>Legislature</i> and a <i>Convention</i>
is, for the first time, introduced into Connecticut,
by the recommendation of the late convention of
States, in order to adopt the new constitution. The
Legislature of the State, without adverting to laws or
practice, immediately recommended a convention for
that purpose. Yet a distinction between a <i>Convention</i>
and a <i>Legislature</i> is, in that State, a palpable absurdity,
even by their own laws; for there is no constitution
in the State, except its laws, which are always repealable
by an ordinary Legislature; and the laws and uniform
practice, from the first organization of the government,
declare that <i>the Legislature has all the power of
all the people</i>. A convention therefore can have no
more power, and differs no more from an ordinary Legislature,
than one Legislature does from another. Or
rather it is no more than a Legislature chosen for <i>one
particular purpose</i> of supremacy; whereas an ordinary
Legislature is competent to <i>all</i> purposes of supremacy.
<span class="pb" id="Pg055">[pg 055]</span>
But had the Legislature of that State ratified or rejected
the new constitution, without consulting their constituents,
their act would have been valid and binding. This
is the excellence of the constitution of Connecticut,
that the <i>Legislature</i> is considered as the <i>body of the people</i>;
and the people have not been taught to make a distinction
which should never exist, and consider themselves
as <i>masters</i> of their <i>rulers</i>, and their power as paramount
to the laws. To this excellence in her frame of government,
that State is indebted for uniformity and stability
in public measures, during a period of one hundred
and fifty years; a period of unparalleled tranquillity, never
once disturbed by a violent obstruction of justice, or any
popular commotion or rebellion. Wretched indeed
would be the people of that State, should they adopt the
vulgar maxim, that their rulers are their <i>servants</i>. We
then may expect that the <i>laws</i> of those <i>servants</i> will be
treated with the same contempt, as they are in some
other States.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" title="This pernicious error subverts the whole foundation of government. It resembles the practice of some Gentlemen in the country, who hire a poor strolling vagabond to keep a school, and then let the children know that he is a mere servant. The consequence is, the children despise him and his rules, and a constant war is maintained between the master and his pupils. The boys think themselves more respectable than the master, and the master has the rod in his hand, which he never fails to exercise...." class="fnanchor">[22]</a> </p>

<p>But from the manner in which government is constituted,
it is evident that there is no power residing in
the State at large, which does not reside in the legislature.
I know it is said that government originates
in <i>compact</i>; but I am very confident, that if this is true,
the <i>compact</i> is different from any other kind of compact
that is known among men. In all other <i>compacts</i>,
<i>agreements</i> or <i>covenants</i>, the assent of every person concerned,
or who is to be bound by the compact, is requisite
to render it valid and obligatory upon such person.
<span class="pb" id="Pg056">[pg 056]</span>
But I very much question whether this ever takes
place in any constitution of government.</p>

<p>Perhaps so far there is an <i>implied compact</i> in government,
that every man consents to be bound by the opinion
of a majority; but this is all a <i>supposition</i>; for the
consent of a hundredth part of a society is never obtained.</p>

<p>The truth is, government originates in <i>necessity</i> and
<i>utility</i>; and whether there is an implied compact or
not, the opinions of the <i>few</i> must be overruled, and
submit to the opinions of the <i>many</i>. But the opinions
of a majority cannot be known, but in an Assembly of
the whole society; and no <i>part</i> of the society has a
right to decide upon a measure which equally affects
the <i>whole</i>, without a consultation with the whole, to
hear their arguments and objections. It is said that <i>all</i>
power resides in the <i>people</i>; but it must be remembered,
that let the supreme power be where it will, it can
be exercised only in an <i>Assembly of the whole State</i>, or in
an <i>Assembly of the Representativs of the whole State</i>.</p>

<p>Suppose the power to reside in the people, yet they
cannot, and they have no right to exercise it in their
scattered districts, and the reason is very obvious; it is
impossible that the propriety of a measure can be ascertained,
without the best general information, and a full
knowlege of the opinions of the men on whom it is to
operate.</p>

<p>By opinions here I would not be understood to mean,
the various opinions formed on a view of a particular
interest, for these opinions may be obtained by sending
to each district, and collecting instructions; but I mean
the <i>opinions</i> of the <i>whole society</i>, formed on the <i>information</i>
and <i>debates</i> of the <i>whole society</i>. These opinions can
be formed no where but in a Convention of the <i>whole
State</i>, or of their <i>Representativs</i>. So far therefore are the
people from having a power paramount to that of their
Representativs in Convention, that they can exercise no
act of supremacy or legislation at all, but in a Convention
of the whole State by Representativs.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" title="'In a democracy there can be no exercise of sovereignty but by suffrage: In England, where the people do not debate in a collective body, but by representation, the exercise of this sovereignty consists in the choice of Representatives.' Blackstone's Com. b. 1. ch. 2. This is the sole power of the people in America." class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Unless
<span class="pb" id="Pg057">[pg 057]</span>
therefore, it can be proved that a <i>Convention</i>, so called,
which is composed mostly of the same men as a Legislature,
possesses some wisdom, power or qualifications,
which a Legislature <i>does not</i> and <i>cannot</i>, then the distinction
is useless and trifling. A Legislature is supposed
to consist of men whom the people judge best qualified
to superintend their interests; a convention cannot be
composed of better men; and in fact we find it generally
composed of the <i>same men</i>. If therefore no act of
sovereignty can be exercised but in an Assembly of Representativs,
of what consequence is it, whether we call
it a <i>Convention</i> or a <i>Legislature</i>? or why is not the Assembly
of Representativs of a people, at all times a <i>Convention</i>,
as well as a <i>Legislature</i>?</p>

<p>To me it appears that a distinction is made without
a difference; but a distinction that will often prevent
good measures, perpetuate evils in government, and by
creating a pretended power paramount to the Legislature,
tend to bring laws into contempt.</p>

<p>POSTSCRIPT.&mdash;&mdash; This reasoning applies solely
to the individual States, and not to the United States,
before they were formed into a federal body. An important
<ins class="corr" title="dictinction" id="C057">distinction</ins> must be observed between the <i>Constitution
of a sovereign State</i>, and of <i>thirteen distinct sovereignties</i>.
In a sovereign State, whatever they may
suggest to the contrary, the voices of a majority are
binding upon the minority, even in framing the first plan
of government. In general, a majority of the votes of
the <i>Representativs</i> in Legislature or Convention have
been admitted as obligatory upon every member of the
State, in forming and establishing a Constitution: But
when the Constitution has been submitted to the people,
as it is called, in town meetings or other small assemblies,
the assent of every individual could not be expressly
obtained; and the dissent of any number, less
than half the freemen present, who might not be one
half the whole number in the State, could not prevent
<span class="pb" id="Pg058">[pg 058]</span>
the establishment of the government, nor invalidate the
obligation of <i>every man</i> to submit peaceably to its operation.
The members of a state or community, cannot
<i>from necessity</i>, be considered as parties to a contract,
where the assent of every man is necessary to bind him
to a performance of the engagement. But the several
States, enter into a negociation like <i><ins class="err" title="contrary" id="E058">contracting</ins> parties</i>;
they agree that the assent of every individual State, shall
be requisite to bind that State; and the frame of government,
so agreed upon, is considered as a compact
between independent sovereignties, which derives its
binding force from the mutual and unanimous consent
of the parties, and not merely from a necessity that the
major part of the people should compel the rest to submission.</p>

<p>But in this very compact, the States have resigned
their independent sovereignty, and become a single body
or state, as to certain purposes; for they have solemnly
contracted with each other, that <i>three fourths of</i> their
number may alter and amend the first compact. They
are therefore no longer separate individuals and contracting
parties; but they form a single State or body
politic; and a majority of three fourths can exert every
act of sovereignty, except in two or three particulars,
expressly reserved in the compact.</p>

<p class="center"><big><span class="smcap">On</span> GOVERNMENT.</big></p>

<p>The constitution of Virginia, like that of Connecticut,
stands on the true principles of a Republican
Representativ Government. It is not shackled
with a Bill of Rights, and every part of it, is at any time,
alterable by an ordinary Legislature. When I say <i>every
part</i> of the constitution is alterable, I would except the
right of elections, for the Representativs have not power
to prolong the period of their own delegation. This
is not numbered among the rights of legislation, and
deserves a separate consideration. This right is not
vested in the Legislature; it is in the people at large;
it cannot be alienated without changing the form of
government. Nay the right of election is not only the
<i>basis</i>, but the <i>whole frame</i> or essence of a republican constitution;
it is not merely <i>one</i>, but it is the <i>only</i> legislativ
or constitutional act, which the people at large can
with propriety exercise.</p>

<p>The simple principle for which I contend is this,
"That in a representativ democracy, the delegates
chosen for Legislators ought, at all times, to be competent
to every possible act of legislation <i>under that form of
government</i>; but not to <i>change that form</i>." Besides it
is contrary to all our ideas of <i>deputation</i> or <i>agency for
others</i>, that the person acting should have the power of
extending the period of agency beyond the time specified
in his commission. The Representativ of a people
is, as to his powers, in the situation of an Attorney,
whose letters commission him to do every thing which
his constituent would do, where he on the spot; but
for a limited time only. At the expiration of that time
his powers cease; and a Representativ has no more
right to extend that period, than a plenipotentiary has
to renew his commission. The British Parliament, by
<span class="pb" id="Pg060">[pg 060]</span>
prolonging the period of their existence from one to
three, and from three to seven years, committed an unjust
act; an act however which has been confirmed by
the acquiescence of the nation, and thus received the
highest constitutional sanction. I am sensible that the
Americans are much concerned for the liberties of the
British nation; and the act for making Parliaments
septennial is often mentioned as an arbitrary, oppressiv
act, destructiv of English liberty.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" title="The septennial act was judged the only guard against a Popish reign, and therefore highly popular." class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The English are
doubtless obliged to us for our tender concern for their
happiness; yet for myself I entertain no such ideas: The
English have generally understood and advocated their
rights as well as any nation, and I am confident that
the nation enjoys as much happiness and freedom, and
much more tranquillity, under septennial Parliaments,
than they would with annual elections. Corruption
to obtain offices will ever attend wealth; it is generated
with it, grows up with it, and will always fill a
country with violent factions and illegal practices. Such
are the habits of the people, that money will have a
principal influence in carrying elections; and such vast
sums are necessary for the purpose, that if elections were
annual, none but a few of the wealthiest men could defray
the expense; the landholders of moderate estates
would not offer themselves as candidates; and thus in
fact annual elections, with the present habits of the
people, would actually diminish the influence of the
Commons, by throwing the advantage into the hands
of a corrupt ministry, and a few overgrown nabobs.
Before annual elections would be a blessing to the English,
their habits must be changed; but this cannot be
effected by human force. I wish my countrymen would
believe that other nations understand and can guard
their privileges, without any lamentable outcries from
this side of the Atlantic. Government will always take
its complexion from the habits of the people; habits
are continually changing from age to age; a body of
Legislators taken from the people, will generally represent
<span class="pb" id="Pg061">[pg 061]</span>
these habits at the time when they are chosen:
Hence these two important conclusions, 1st, That a legislativ
body should be frequently renewed and always
taken from the people: 2d, That a government which
is perpetual, or incapable of being accommodated to
every change of national habits, must in time become a
<i>bad</i> government.</p>

<p>With this view of the subject, I cannot suppress my
surprise at the reasoning of Mr. Jefferson on this very
point.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" title="Notes on Virginia, page 197. Lond. Edit. Query 13." class="fnanchor">[25]</a> He considers it as a defect in the constitution
of Virginia, that <i>it can be altered by an ordinary Legislature</i>.
He observes that the Convention which framed
the present constitution of that State, "received no
powers in their creation which were not given to every
Legislature before and since. So far and no farther authorised,
they organized the government by the ordinance
entitled a Constitution or form of government.
It pretends to no higher authority than the other ordinances
of the same session; it does not say, that it shall
be perpetual; that it shall be unalterable by other Legislatures;
that it shall be transcendant above the powers
of those, who they knew would have equal powers with
themselves."</p>

<p>But suppose the framers of this ordinance had said,
that it should be <i>perpetual</i> and <i>unalterable</i>; such a declaration
would have been void. Nay, altho the people
themselves had individually and unanimously declared
the ordinance perpetual, the declaration would have
been invalid. One Assembly cannot pass an act, binding
upon a subsequent Assembly of equal authority;<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" title="Contracts, where a Legislature is a party, are excepted." class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
and the people in 1776, had no authority, and consequently
could delegate none, to pass a single act which
the people in 1777, could not repeal and annul. And
Mr. Jefferson himself, in the very next sentence, assigns
a reason, which is an unanswerable argument in favor
of my position, and a complete refutation of his own.
These are his words. "Not only the silence of the instrument
is a proof they thought it would be alterable,
<span class="pb" id="Pg062">[pg 062]</span>
but their own practice also: For this very Convention,
meeting as a House of Delegates in General Assembly
with the new Senate in the autumn of that year, passed
acts of Assembly in contradiction to their ordinance of
government; and <i>every Assembly from that time to this,
has done the same</i>."</p>

<p>Did Mr. Jefferson reflect upon the inference that
would be justly drawn from these facts? Did he not
consider that he was furnishing his opponents with the
most effectual weapons against himself? The acts passed
by <i>every subsequent Assembly in contradiction to the first ordinance</i>,
prove that all the Assemblies were <i>fallible</i> men;
and consequently not competent to make <i>perpetual Constitutions</i>
for future generations. To give Mr. Jefferson,
and the other advocates for <i>unchangeable Constitutions</i>,
the fullest latitude in their argument, I will suppose
every freeman of Virginia, could have been assembled
to deliberate upon a form of government, and that
the present form, or even one more perfect, had been
the result of their Councils; and that they had declared
it unalterable. What would have been the consequence?
Experience would probably have discovered,
what is the fact; and what forever will be the case;
that <i>Conventions</i> are not possessed of <i>infinite wisdom</i>; that
the wisest men cannot devise a perfect system of government.
After all this solemn national transaction, and
a formal declaration that their proceedings should be
unalterable, suppose a single article of the Constitution
should be found to interfere with some national benefit,
some material advantage; where would be the
power to change or reform that article? In the same
general Assembly of all the people, and in no other body.
But must a State be put to this inconvenience, to find
a remedy for every defect of constitution?</p>

<p>Suppose, however, the <i>Convention</i> had been empowered
to declare the form of government <i>unalterable</i>: What
would have been the consequence? Mr. Jefferson himself
has related the consequence. Every succeeding Assembly
has found errors or defects in that frame of government,
and has happily applied a remedy. But had
<span class="pb" id="Pg063">[pg 063]</span>
not every Legislature had power to make these alterations,
Virginia must have gone thro the farce, and the
trouble of calling an <i>extraordinary</i> Legislature, to do that
which an <i>ordinary</i> Legislature could do just as well, in
their annual session; or those errors must have remained
in the constitution, to the injury of the State.</p>

<p>The whole argument for Bills of Rights and unalterable
Constitutions rests on two suppositions, viz. that
the Convention which frames the government, is <i>infallible</i>;
and that future Legislatures will be <i>less honest</i>,
<i>less wise</i>, and <i>less attentiv to the interest of the State</i>, than
a present Convention: The first supposition is <i>always
false</i>, and the last is <i>generally</i> so. A declaration of perpetuity,
annexed to a form of government, implies a
supposition of <i>perfect wisdom and probity</i> in the framers;
which is both arrogant and impudent; and it implies a
supposed power in them, to abridge the power of a succeeding
Convention, and of the future state or body
of people. The last supposition is, in every possible
instance of legislation, <i>false</i>; and an attempt to exercise
such a power, a high handed act of tyranny. But setting
aside the argument, grounded on a want of power
in one Assembly to abridge the power of another, what
occasion have we to be so jealous of future Legislatures?
Why should we be so anxious to guard the future
rights of a nation? Why should we not distrust the people
and the Representativs of the present age, as well as
those of future ages, in whose acts we have not the smallest
interest? For my part, I believe that the peeple and
their Representativs, two or three centuries hence, will
be as honest, as wise, as faithful to themselves, and will
understand their rights as well, and be as able to defend
them, as the people are at this period. The contrary
supposition is absurd.</p>

<p>I know it is said, that other nations have lost their
liberties by the ambitious designs of their rulers, and we
may do the same. The experience of other nations,
furnishes the ground of all the arguments used in favor
of an unalterable constitution. The advocates seem
determined that posterity shall not lose their liberty,
<span class="pb" id="Pg064">[pg 064]</span>
even if they should be willing and desirous to surrender
it. If a few declarations on parchment, will secure a
single blessing to posterity, which they would otherwise
lose, I resign the argument, and will receive a thousand
declarations. Yet so thoroughly convinced am I of
the opposite tendency and effect of such unalterable declarations,
that, were it possible to render them valid, I
should deem every article an infringement of civil and
political liberty. I should consider every article as a
restriction which might impose some duty which in time
might cease to be useful and necessary, while the obligation
of performing it might remain; or which in its
operation might prove pernicious, by producing effects
which were not expected, and could not be foreseen.
There is no one single right, no privilege, which is commonly
deemed fundamental, which may not, by an unalterable
establishment, preclude some amendment,
some improvement in future administration of government.
And unless the advocates for unalterable constitutions
of government, can prevent all changes in the
wants, the inclinations, the habits, and the circumstances
of people, they will find it difficult, even with all
their declarations of unalterable rights, to prevent
changes in government. A paper declaration is a very
feeble barrier against the force of national habits, and
inclinations.</p>

<p>The loss of liberty, as it is called, in the kingdoms of
Europe, has, in several instances, been a mere change of
government, effected by a change of habits, and in some
instances this change has been favorable to liberty.
The government of Denmark, was changed from a
mixed form, like that of England, to an absolute monarchy,
by a solemn deliberate act of the people or States.
Was this a loss of liberty? So far from it, that the
change removed the oppressions of faction, restored liberty
to the subject and tranquillity to the kingdom. The
change was a blessing to the people. It indeed lodged
a power in the Prince to dispose of life and property;
but at the same time it lodged in him a <i>power to defend
both</i>; a power which before was lodged <i>no where</i>; and
<span class="pb" id="Pg065">[pg 065]</span>
it is infinitely better that such a power should be vested
in a <i>single hand</i>, than that it should <i>not exist at all</i>. The
monarchy of France has grown out of a number of petty
states and lordships; yet it is a fact, proved by history
and experience, that the subjects of that kingdom have
acquired liberty, peace and happiness, in proportion to
the diminution of the powers of the petty sovereignties,
and the extension of the prerogativs of the Monarch.
It is said that Spain lost her liberties under the reign of
Charles Vth; but I question the truth of the assertion;
it is probable that the subject has gained as much by an
abridgement of the powers of the nobility, as he lost by
an annihilation of the Cortez. The United Netherlands
fought with more bravery and perseverance to
preserve their rights, than any other people since the
days of Leonidas; and yet no sooner established a government,
so jealously guarded as to defeat its own
designs, and prevent the good effects of government,
than they neglected its principles; the freemen resigned
the privilege of election, and committed their liberties
to a rich aristocracy. There was no compulsion, no
external force in producing this revolution; but the
form of government, which had been established on
paper, and solemnly ratified, was not suited to the genius
of the subjects. The burghers had the right of
electing their rulers; but they neglected it voluntarily;
and a <i>bill of rights</i>, a <i>perpetual constitution</i> on parchment,
guaranteeing that right, was a useless form of words, because
opposed to the temper of the people. The government
assumed a complexion, more correspondent to
their habits, and tho in theory no constitution is more
cautiously guarded against an infringement of popular
privileges, yet in practice it is a real aristocracy.</p>

<p>The progress of government in England has been the
reverse: The people have been gaining freedom by intrenching
upon the powers of the nobles and the royal
prerogativs. These changes in government do not proceed
from <i>bills of rights</i>, <i>unalterable forms</i> and <i>perpetual
establishments</i>; liberty is never secured by such paper
declarations, nor lost for want of them. The truth is,
<span class="pb" id="Pg066">[pg 066]</span>
Government originates in necessity, and takes its form
and structure from the genius and habits of the people;
and if on paper a form is not accommodated to those
habits, it will assume a new form, in spite of all the
formal sanctions of the supreme authority of a State.
Were the monarchy of France to be dissolved, and the
wisest system of republican government ever invented,
solemnly declared, by the King and his council, to be
the constitution of the kingdom; the people with their
present habits, would refuse to receive it; and resign
their privileges to their beloved sovereign. But so opposite
are the habits of the Americans, that an attempt
to erect a monarchy or an aristocracy over the United
States, would expose the authors to the loss of their
heads.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" title="Some jealous people ignorantly call the proposed Constitution of Federal Government, an aristocracy. If such men are honest, their honesty deserves pity: There is not a feature of true aristocracy in the Constitution; the whole frame of Government is a pure Representativ Republic." class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The truth is, the people of Europe, since they
have become civilized, have, in no kingdom, possessed
<i>all</i> the true principles of liberty. They could not therefore
lose what they never possessed. There have been,
from time immemorial, some rights of government,
some prerogativs vested in some man or body of men,
independent of the suffrages of the body of the subjects.
This circumstance distinguishes the governments of
Europe and of all the world, from those of America.
There has been in the free nations of Europe an incessant
struggle between freedom or national rights, and
hereditary prerogativs. The contest has ended variously
in different kingdoms; but generally in depressing
the power of the nobility; ascertaining and limiting
the prerogativs of the crown, and extending the privileges
of the people. The Americans have seen the records
of their struggles; and without considering that
the objects of the contest <i>do not exist in this country</i>; they
are laboring to guard rights which there is no party to
attack. They are as jealous of their rights, as if there
existed here a King's prerogativs, or the powers of nobles,
independent of their own will and choice, and ever eager
<span class="pb" id="Pg067">[pg 067]</span>
to swallow up their liberties. But there is <i>no man</i> in
America, who claims any rights but what are common
to <i>every man</i>; there is no man who has an interest in
invading popular privileges, because his attempt to curtail
another's rights, would expose his own to the same
abridgement. The jealousy of people in this country
has no proper object against which it can rationally arm
them; it is therefore directed <i>against themselves</i>, or
against an invasion which they <i>imagine</i> may happen in
future ages. The contest for <i>perpetual bills of rights</i>
against a future tyranny, resembles Don Quixote's fighting
windmills; and I never can reflect on the declamation
about an <i>unalterable constitution</i> to guard certain
rights, without wishing to add another article, as necessary
as those that are generally mentioned, viz. "that
no future Convention or Legislature shall cut their own
throats, or those of their constituents." While the
habits of the Americans remain as they are, the people
will choose their Legislature from their own body; that
Legislature will have an interest inseparable from that
of the people, and therefore an act to restrain their power
in any article of legislation, is as unnecessary as an act
to prevent them from committing suicide.</p>

<p>Mr. Jefferson, in answer to those who maintain that
the form of government in Virginia is unalterable, because
it is called a <i>constitution</i>, which, ex vi termini,
means an act above the power of the ordinary Legislature,
asserts that <i>constitution</i>, <i>statute</i>, <i>law</i> and <i>ordinance</i>,
are synonymous terms, and convertible as they are
used by writers on government. Constitutio dicitur jus
quod a principe conditur. Constitutum, quod ab imperatoribus
rescriptum statutumve est. Statutum, idem
quod lex.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" title="Calvini Lexicon Juridicum." class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Here the words <i>constitution</i>, <i>statute</i> and <i>law</i>,
are defined by each other; they were used as convertible
terms by all former writers, whether Roman or
British; and before the terms of the civil law were introduced,
our Saxon ancestors used the correspondent
English words, <i>bid</i> and <i>set</i>.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" title="See Laws of the Saxon Kings." class="fnanchor">[29]</a> From hence he concludes
<span class="pb" id="Pg068">[pg 068]</span>
that no inference can be drawn from the meaning of
the word, that a <i>constitution</i> has a higher authority than
a law or statute. This conclusion of Mr. Jefferson is
just.</p>

<p>He quotes Lord Coke also to prove that any parliament
can abridge, suspend or qualify the acts of a preceding
Parliament. It is a maxim in their laws, that
"Leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant." After
having fully proved that <i>constitution</i>, <i>statute</i>, <i>law</i> and <i>ordinance</i>,
are words of similar import, and that the constitution
of Virginia is at any time alterable by the ordinary
Legislature, he proceeds to prove the danger to
which the rights of the people are exposed, for want of
an <i>unalterable form of government</i>. The first proof of
this danger he mentions, is, the power which the Assembly
exercises of determining its own quorum. The
British Parliament fixes its own quorum: The former
Assemblies of Virginia did the same. During the war
the Legislature determined that <i>forty</i> members should
be a quorum to proceed to business, altho not a fourth
part of the whole house. The danger of delay, it was
judged, would warrant the measure. This precedent,
our writer supposes, is subversive of the principles of the
government, and dangerous to liberty.</p>

<p>It is a dictate of natural law that a <i>majority should govern</i>;
and the principle is universally received and established
in all societies, where no other mode has been
arbitrarily fixed. This natural right cannot be alienated
<i>in perpetuum</i>; for altho a Legislature, or even the
body of the people, may resign the powers of government
to forty, or to four men, when they please, yet
they may likewise resume them at pleasure.</p>

<p>The people may, if they please, create a dictator on
an emergency in war, but his creation would not <i>destroy</i>,
but merely <i>suspend</i> the natural right of the <i>Lex majoris
partis</i>. Thus forty members, a minority of the Legislature
of Virginia, were empowered during a dangerous
invasion, to legislate for the State; but any subsequent
Assembly might have divested them of that power.
During the operation of the law, vesting them with this
<span class="pb" id="Pg069">[pg 069]</span>
power, their acts were binding upon the State; because
their power was derived from the general sense of the
State; it was actually derived from a legal majority.
But that majority could, at any moment, resume the
power and practice on their natural right.</p>

<p>It is a standing law of Connecticut, that forty men shall
be a quorum of the House of Representativs, which consists
of about 170 members. This law, I am confident,
never excited a murmur, or a suspicion that the liberties of
the people were in danger; yet this law creates an oligarchy;
it is an infringement of natural right; it subjects
the State to the possibility, and even the probability of being
governed at times by a minority. The acquiescence
of the State, in the existence of the law, gives validity,
and even the sanction of a majority, to the acts of that
minority; but the majority may at any time resume
their natural right, and make the assent of more than
half of the members, necessary to give validity to their
determinations.</p>

<p>The danger therefore arising from a power in the Assembly
to determine their own quorum, is merely ideal,
for no law can be perpetual; the authority of a majority
of the people, or of their Representativs, is always
competent to repeal any act that is found unjust or inconvenient.
The acquiescence however of the people
of the States mentioned, and that in one of them for a
long course of years, under an oligarchy; or their submission
to the power of a minority, is an incontestible
proof of what I have before observed, that <i>theories</i> and
<i>forms of government</i> are <i>empty things</i>; that the spirit of a
government springs immediately from the temper of the
people, and the exercise of it will generally take its tone
from their feelings. It proves likewise that a <i>union of
interests</i> between the rulers and the people, which union
will always coexist with free elections, is not only the
<i>best</i>, but the <i>only</i> security for their liberties which they
can wish for and demand. The Government of Connecticut
is a solid proof of these truths. The Assembly
of that State, have always had power to abolish trial by
jury, to restrain the liberty of the press, to suspend the
<span class="pb" id="Pg070">[pg 070]</span>
habeas corpus act, to maintain a standing army, in short
to command every engine of despotism; yet by some
means or other, it happens that the rights of the people
are not invaded, and the subjects have generally been
better satisfied with the laws, than the people of any
other State. The reason is, the Legislature is a part of
the people, and has the <i>same interest</i>. If a law should
prove bad, the Legislature can repeal it; but in the <i>unalterable</i>
bills of rights in some of the States, if an article
should prove wrong and oppressiv, an ordinary Legislature
cannot repeal or amend it; and the State will
hardly think of calling a special Convention for so trifling
a purpose. There are some articles, in several of
the State Constitutions, which are glaring infractions of
the first rights of freemen; yet they affect not a majority
of the community; and centuries may elapse before
the evil can be redressed, and a respectable class of men
restored to the enjoyment of their rights.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" title="Such is the article, which excludes the clergy from a right to hold civil offices. The people, might, with the same propriety, have declared, that no merchants nor lawyers should be eligible to civil offices. It is a common opinion that the business of the clergy is wholly spiritual. Never was a grosser error. A part of their business is to inform the minds of people on all subjects, and correct their morals; so that they have a direct influence on government...." class="fnanchor">[30]</a> </p>

<p>To prove the want of an <i>unalterable Constitution</i> in
Virginia, Mr. Jefferson informs us that in 1776, during
the distressed circumstances of the State, a proposition
was made in the House of Delegates to create a Dictator,
invested with every power, legislativ, executiv and
judicial, civil and military. In June, 1781, under a
great calamity, the proposition was repeated, and was
near being passed. By the warmth he discovers in reprobating
this proposal, one must suppose that the creation
of a Dictator even for a few months, would have
buried every remain of freedom. Yet he seems to allow
that the step would have been justified, had there
existed an <i>irresistible necessity</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg071">[pg 071]</span>
Altho it is possible that a case may happen, in which
the creation of a Dictator might be the only resort to
save life, liberty, property and the State, as it happened
in Rome more than once; yet I should dread his power
as much as any man, were I not convinced that the
same men that appointed him, could, in a moment,
strip him of his tremendous authority. A Dictator,
with an army superior to the strength of the State, would
be a despot; but Mr. Jefferson's fears seem grounded
on the authority derived from the Legislature. A concession
of power from the Legislature, or the people,
is a voluntary suspension of a natural <i>unalienable</i> right;
and is resumeable at the expiration of the period specified,
or the moment it is abused. A State can never
alienate a <i>natural right</i>; for it cannot legislate for those
who are not in existence. It may consent to suspend
that right for great and temporary purposes; but were
every freeman in Virginia to assent to the creation of a
<i>perpetual Dictator</i>, the act in itself would be void. The
expedient of creating a Dictator is dangerous, and no
free people would willingly resort to it; but there may
be times when this expedient is necessary to save a State
from ruin, and when every man in a State would cheerfully
give his suffrage for adopting it. At the same
time, a temporary investiture of unlimited powers in
one man, may be abused; it may be an influential precedent;
and the continuance of it, may furnish the
Dictator with the means of perpetuating his office. The
distress of a people must be extreme, before a serious
thought of a Dictator can be justifiable. But the people
who create, can annihilate a Dictator; their right to
govern themselves cannot be resigned by any act whatever,
altho extreme cases may vindicate them in suspending
the exercise of it. Even prescription cannot
exist against this right; and <i>every</i> nation in Europe has
a <i>natural</i> right to depose its King, and take the government
into its own hands; altho it may forever be inexpedient
for any of them to exercise the right.</p>

<p>I have said,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" title="No. II. IV. V." class="fnanchor">[31]</a> "that the people ought not to give
binding instructions to Representativs." "That
they cannot exercise any act of supremacy or legislation
at all but in a Convention of the whole State, or of the
Representativs of the whole State." And "That the
right of election is the <i>only</i> constitutional right which
they can with propriety exercise." That these positions,
however repugnant to the received opinions of
the present age, are capable of political demonstration,
is to me unquestionable. They all convey nearly the
same idea, and if true, they contravene, in some measure,
a fundamental maxim of American politics, which is,
that "the sovereign power resides in the people."</p>

<p>I am not desirous of subverting this favorite maxim;
but I am very desirous it should be properly qualified
and understood; for the abuse of it is capable of shaking
any government; and I have no doubt that the
mistakes which this maxim has introduced, have been
the principal sources of rebellion, tumult and disorder
in several of the American States.</p>

<p>It is doubtless true, that the individuals who compose
a political society or State, have a sovereign right to establish
what form of government they please in their
own territories. But in order to deliberate upon the
subject, they must all convene together, as in Rome and
Athens; or must send deputies, vested with powers to
act for them, as is the practice in England and America.
If they adopt the first method, then the Supreme Legislativ
power resides, to all intents and purposes, in the whole
body of the people. If, from the local circumstances
of the people, the whole body cannot meet for deliberation,
<span class="pb" id="Pg073">[pg 073]</span>
then the Legislativ powers do not reside in the
people at large, but in an assembly of men delegated by
the whole body.</p>

<p>To prove this last position, it is necessary to enquire,
what is the object of law, and on what principles ought
it to be founded? A law, if I understand the term, is
an act of the <i>whole State</i>, operating upon the <i>whole State</i>,
either by command or prohibition: It is thus distinguished
from a <i>resolve</i> which more properly respects an
individual or a part of the State.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" title="It is a capital defect in some of the States, that the government is so organized as not to admit subordinate acts of legislation in small districts. In these States, every little collection of people in a village must petition the Legislature for liberty to lay out a highway or build a bridge; an affair in which the State at large has very little interest, and of the necessity and utility of which the Legislature are not suitable judges. This occasions much trouble for the State;...." class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The object of a law
is to prevent positiv evil or produce positiv good to the
<i>whole State</i>; not merely to a particular part. The
principle therefore on which all laws should be founded,
is, <i>a regard to the greatest good which can be produced
to the greatest number of individuals in the State</i>. The
principle is so obvious, that I presume it will not be
controverted. Permit me then to enquire, whether the
people of any district, county or town, in their local meetings,
are competent to judge of this <i>general good</i>? A
law, which is, in its operation <i>general</i>, must be founded
on the best <i>general information</i>: The people themselves
have no right to consent to a law, without this general
information: They have no right to consent to a law,
on a view of a local interest; nor without hearing the
objections and arguments, and examining the amendments,
suggested by every part of the community, which
is to be affected by that law. To maintain the contrary
<span class="pb" id="Pg074">[pg 074]</span>
is to defend the most glaring contradictions. But
can the inhabitants, in detached associations, be acquainted
with these objections and arguments? Can they
know the minds of their brethren at the distance of three
or five hundred miles? If they cannot, they do not possess
the right of legislation. Little will it avail to say, that
the people acquire the necessary information by newspapers,
or other periodical publications: There are not
more than two States in the thirteen, where one half the
freemen read the public papers. But if every freeman
read the papers, this would not give him the information
necessary to qualify him for a Legislator; for
but a small part of the intelligence they contain is official,
which alone can be the ground of law; nor can the
collectiv sense of a nation or state be gathered from newspapers.
The whole body of people, or Representativs
of the whole body, are the only vehicles of information
which can be trusted, in forming a judgement of
the true interest of the whole State.</p>

<p>If the <i>collectiv sense</i> of a State is the basis of law, and
that sense can be known officially no where but in an
Assembly of all the people or of their Representativs;
or in other words, if there can be no such thing as a <i>collection
of sentiments</i> made in any other manner, than by
a Convention of the whole people or their Delegates,
where is the right of <i>instructing Representativs</i>? The
sense of the people, taken in small meetings, without a
general knowlege of the objections, and reasonings of
the whole State, ought not to be considered as the true
sense of the State; for not being possessed of the best
general information, the people often form wrong opinions
of their own interest. Had I the journals of the several
Legislatures in America, I would prove to every
man's satisfaction, that most of the schemes for paper
money, tender laws, suspension of laws for the recovery
of debts, and most of the destructiv measures which have
been pursued by the States, have originated in towns and
counties, and been carried by positiv instructions from
constituents to Representativs. The freemen, in these
cases, have wrong ideas of their own interest; their error,
<span class="pb" id="Pg075">[pg 075]</span>
in the first instance, is ascribeable merely to ignorance,
or a want of that just information, which they
themselves would obtain in a General Assembly.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" title="An error, originating in mistake, is often pursued thro obstinacy and pride; and sometimes a familiarity with falsehood, makes it appear like truth." class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The
right therefore of prescribing rules to govern the votes
of Representativs, which is so often assumed, frequently
amounts to a right of doing infinite mischief, with the
best intentions. There is perhaps no case in which the
people at large are so capable of knowing and pursuing
their own interest, as their Delegates are when assembled
for consultation and debate. But the practice of giving
binding instructions to Representativs, if it has any
foundation, is built on this maxim, that the constituents,
on a view of their local interests, and either with
none, or very imperfect information, are better judges
of the propriety of a law, and of the general good, than
the most judicious men are (for such generally are the
Representativs) after attending to the best official information
from every quarter, and after a full discussion
of the subject in an Assembly, where clashing interests
conspire to detect error, and suggest improvements.
This maxim is obviously false; and a practice built on
it, cannot fail to produce laws, inaccurate, contradictory,
capricious and subversive of the first rights of men.
Perhaps no country, except America, ever experienced
the fatal effects of this practice, and I blush to remark,
what candor itself must avow, that few arbitrary governments,
have in so short a period, exhibited so many
<i>legal infractions</i> of sacred right; so many public invasions
of private property; so many wanton abuses of legislativ
powers! Yet the people are generally honest; and
as well informed as the people of any country. Their
errors proceed from ignorance; from false maxims of
governments. The people attempt to legislate without
the necessary qualifications for lawgivers; yes, <i>they legislate
at home!</i> and while this practice subsists, our public
measures will be often weak, imperfect, and changeable;
and sometimes <i>extremely iniquitous</i>. From these
<span class="pb" id="Pg076">[pg 076]</span>
considerations, it appears that the powers of a Representativ
should be wholly discretionary when he acts as a
Legislator; but as an agent for a town or small society,
he may have positiv instructions. His constituents, in
the last case, are competent to instruct him, because they
are the whole body concerned; but in the first instance,
they are but a part of the State, and not competent to
judge fully of the interest of the whole.</p>

<p>To place the matter in the strongest point of light, let
us suppose a small State, in which the whole body of
people meet for the purpose of making laws. Suppose
in this democracy, the people of a town or other district
should desire a particular act, for instance, a tender
law. Would the inhabitants of this town, have a right
to meet a few weeks before the General Assembly, where
they all would expect to be present, to debate and vote;
and in this town meeting take an oath, or otherwise
bind themselves to vote for the act? Would they have
a right to shut their ears against argument; to lay a restraint
upon their own minds; to exclude the possibility
of conviction, and solemnly swear to vote in a certain
manner, whether right or wrong! If in this case, the
people of a district have no right to lay a restraint upon
themselves before they enter the General Assembly,
neither have they a right, in representativ democracies,
to lay such a restraint upon their Delegates. The very
reason why they are incompetent to direct their <i>Deputies</i>,
is that they cannot determine how to act <i>themselves</i>,
till they come into the Assembly. The very
doctrine of representation in government excludes the
right of giving binding instructions to Deputies. The
design of choosing Representativs is to <i>collect the wisdom
of the State</i>; the Deputies are <i>to unite</i> their Councils;
<i>to meet</i> and <i>consult for</i> the public safety: But positiv
instructions prevent this effect; they are dictated
by local interests, or opinions formed on an imperfect
view of facts and arguments; in short they totally
counteract the good effects of public deliberations, and
prevent those salutary measures which may result from
united Councils. They make the opinions of a small
<span class="pb" id="Pg077">[pg 077]</span>
part of the State a rule for the whole; they imply a decision
of a question, before it is heard; they reduce a
Representativ to a mere machine, by restraining the exercise
of his reason; they subvert the very principles of
republican government.</p>

<p>But let us attend to the inconsistency of the practice.
The oath required of a Representativ, before he takes
his seat, binds him to vote or act from a regard to the
public good, <i>according to his judgement</i> and <i>the best of his
abilities</i>. Some of the Constitutions contain an oath
that binds a Representativ, <i>not to assent to, or vote for, any
act that he shall deem injurious to the people</i>. But what
opinion, what judgement can a man exercise, who is
under the restraint of positiv instructions? Suppose a
man so instructed should in conscience believe that a bill,
if enacted, would be prejudicial to his constituents, yet
his orders bind him to vote for it; how would he act
between his oath and his instructions? In his oath he
has sworn to act according to his judgment, and for the
good of the people; his instructions forbid him to use
his judgment, and bind him to vote for a law which he
is convinced will injure his constituents. He must then
either abandon his orders or his oath; perjury or disobedience
is his only alternativ.</p>

<p>This is no imaginary situation; I presume that many
men have experienced it. One very worthy member
of the Legislature in this State<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" title="New York." class="fnanchor">[34]</a> a few years since, was
in that very predicament; and I heard him express
great anxiety upon the occasion.</p>

<p>How noble was the conduct of that gentleman in
Sandwich (Mass.) who, being chosen to represent the
town in the late Convention, and instructed to vote
against the Constitution, <i>at all events; notwithstanding any
thing that might be said in favor of it</i>; rather than submit
to be fettered in this manner, resigned his appointment.
The name of this gentleman, <span class="smcap">Thomas Bourn</span>,
Esq. ought to be held in veneration by every true friend
to his country, and his address to the electors on that
occasion, ought to be written in letters of gold. It is
<span class="pb" id="Pg078">[pg 078]</span>
recorded in these words: "Fellow Townsmen&mdash;The
line of conduct which has appeared to me right, I have
ever wished to pursue. In the decline of life, when a
few revolving suns at most will bring me to the bar of
impartial justice, I am unwilling to adopt a different, and
less honest mode of acting. It is true, my sentiments
at present are not in favor of the Constitution; open
however to conviction, they may be very different,
when the subject is fairly discussed by able and upright
men. To place myself in a situation, where conviction
could be followed only by a bigotted persistence in error,
would be extremely disagreeable to me. Under the
restrictions with which your Delegates are fettered, <i>the
greatest ideot may answer your purpose as well as the greatest
man</i>. The suffrages of our fellow men, when they
neither repose confidence in our integrity, nor pay a
tribute of respect to our abilities, can never be agreeable.
I am therefore induced positivly to decline accepting
a seat in Convention, whilst I sincerely wish you,
gentlemen, and my countrymen, every blessing which
a wise and virtuous administration of a free government
can secure."</p>

<p>Such a bold and honest independence of mind are
the marks of a good Legislator. With such men as
Mr. Bourn, in the legislativ department, our lives,
liberties and properties are safe. Such a genius, rising
amidst the obscurity of errors and false maxims, like
a star emerging from chaos, spreads the rays of truth
and illuminates the surrounding hemisphere. Considering
the circumstances in which this gentleman was
then placed, I had rather be the author of that short
address, than of all the labored dissertations which have
been written upon the proposed constitution.</p>

<p>Another error, which is connected with the practice
of instructing Representativs, and may perhaps be one
cause of it, is the opinion that a Deputy chosen by a
certain number of freemen, is <i>their Representativ only</i> or
<i>particularly</i>: It seems to be believed that a Representativ
is bound to attend to the <i>particular interest of the men
who elect him</i>, rather than to the <i>general interest</i>. If this
<span class="pb" id="Pg079">[pg 079]</span>
were true, it would obviate, in some measure, the objections
against instructions. But with respect to every
general act, the opinion is <i>clearly false</i>. The reason why
men are chosen by small societies of freemen, and not
by the whole body, is, that the whole body cannot be
well acquainted with the most able men in the different
parts of the State. It is the best expedient to correct
the defects of government, or rather, it is the best <i>practicable</i>
mode of election. To render the mode perfect,
the <i>whole body of freemen</i> should be at liberty to choose
their Delegates from the <i>whole body</i>. This would destroy,
in a great measure, the local views and attachments
which now embarrass government; every Representativ
would be chosen by the whole body; and the
interest of the whole number of constituents would be
his object.</p>

<p>This mode is either impracticable or hazardous;
notwithstanding this, when a Delegate is elected by a
<i>part</i> of the State, he is really the Representativ of the
<i>whole</i>, as much as if he were <i>elected</i> by the whole. The
constituents of every Representativ are not solely those
who <i>voted</i> for him, but the <i>whole State</i>, and the man that
acts from a <i>local</i> interest, and attends merely to the
wishes of those men who elected him, violates his oath,
and abuses his trust. Hence the absurdity of instructions,
which are generally dictated by a partial interest,
and can perhaps in no case be the sole rule of a Legislator's
conduct. When therefore a Representativ says,
<i>such is the wish of my constituents; such are their directions</i>;
his declaration is but partially true; for his instructions
are the wishes of a <i>part</i> only of his constituents. His
constituents, whom he actually represents, and whose
greatest interest is the sole rule of his conduct, are <i>the
whole body of freemen</i>. This is an important truth, and
I must repeat it; the man who is deputed to make laws
for a State, and suffers a local interest to influence his
conduct, abuses a sacred trust; and the Representativ
who obeys his instructions, in opposition to the conviction
of his own mind, arising from a general view of
public good, <i>is guilty of a species of perjury</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg080">[pg 080]</span>
Such are the opinions, which after long deliberation, I
have formed respecting the principles of a republican government.
I feel a diffidence in publishing sentiments so
repugnant to the principles received by my countrymen
and recognized by some of the State Constitutions. But
a strong persuasion of the truth of these opinions, acquired
by reasoning, and confirmed by several years observations,
forbids me to suppress them.</p>

<p>A summary of the truths, deduced from the foregoing
reasoning, is this: That the power of a State is at
all times equal; that neither the people themselves, nor
a Convention of their Delegates, have either the power
or the right to make an unalterable Constitution; that
the power of creating a legislativ body, or the sovereign
right of election, is solely in the people; but the sovereign
power of making laws is solely in an Assembly of
their Representativs; that the people have no right to
give binding instructions to their Representativs; consequently
a distinction between a <i>Convention</i> and a <i>Legislature</i>,
can be merely a difference of <i>forms</i>; that Representativs
have no right to prolong the period of their
delegation; that being taken from the mass of the people,
and having a common interest with them, they will
be influenced, even by private interest, to promote the
public good; and that such a government, which is a
novelty on earth, is perhaps the best that can be framed,
and the only form which will always have for its object,
the general good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="ralign"><small>PHILADELPHIA, 1787.</small></span></p>
<p class="center"><big>REMARKS <i>on the</i> MANNERS, GOVERNMENT,
<i>and</i> DEBT <i>of the</i> <span class="smcap">United
States</span>.</big></p>

<p>Since the declaration and establishment of a general
peace, and since this country has had an opportunity
to experience the effects of her independence,
events have taken place, which were little expected by
the friends of the revolution. It was expected, that
on the ratification of peace, by the belligerent powers,
America would enjoy perfect political tranquillity. The
statesman in his closet, and the divine in his addresses
to heaven, predicted and anticipated the happy period,
when every man would rest, unmolested, under his
own vine and his own fig tree. The merchant foresaw,
in vision, the ports of all nations open to his ships,
and the returns of a favorable commerce pouring
wealth into his coffers. The honest laborer, in the
shop and the field, was told that independence and
peace would forever remove the fears of oppression,
would lighten his burthen, and give him legal security
for the uninterrupted possession of his rights. This
flattering prospect inspired an irresistible enthusiasm in
war. The contention for freedom was long and arduous;
the prize was obtained; the delusion vanished,
and America is surprized at the disappointment.</p>

<p>Instead of general tranquillity, <i>one</i> State has been involved
in a civil war, and most of them are torn with
factions, which weaken or destroy the energy of government.
Instead of a free commerce with all the
world, our trade is every where fettered with restraints
and impositions, dictated by foreign interest; and instead
of pouring wealth into our country, its present
<span class="pb" id="Pg082">[pg 082]</span>
tendency is, to impoverish both the merchant and the
public. Instead of legal security of rights under governments
of our own choice, and under our own control,
we find property at least unsafe, even in our best
toned government. Our charters may be wrested
from us without a fault, our contracts may be changed
or set aside without our consent, by the breath of a
popular Legislature. Instead of a dimunition of taxes,
our public charges are multiplied; and to the weight
of accumulating debts, we are perpetually making accessions
by expensiv follies. Instead of a union of
States and measures, essential to the welfare of a great
nation, each State is jealous of its neighbor, and struggling
for the superiority in wealth and importance, at
the hazard even of our federal existence.</p>

<p>This is the dark side of our public affairs; but such
are the facts. The public and private embarrassments,
which are both seen and felt, are the topics of incessant
declamation. The rhapsodies of orators, and the
publications in gazettes, from the northern to the
southern extremity of the United States, concur in
deprecating the present state of this country, and communicate
the intelligence of our distresses to the whole
civilized world. Nor are newspapers the only heralds
of our calamities. The contempt of government among
one class of men, the silent murmurs of poverty
in the peaceful cottage, and numerous bankrupts in
every quarter, are irresistible evidence to a thinking
mind, that something is wrong.</p>

<p>But declamation is idle, and murmurs fruitless.
Time has been when the minds of people were alarmed
at the approaches of despotism: Then harangues
roused attention; then mobs raised the temple of
freedom, and declared themselves ready to be sacrificed
upon her altar. But violent passions in the public as
well as in the human body, are always transitory.
That enthusiasm which was called <i>public spirit, heroic
virtue, and love of country</i>, has long ago subsided, and is
absorbed in the general steady principle, private interest.
That enthusiasm is not to be rekindled. The expostulations
<span class="pb" id="Pg083">[pg 083]</span>
of our rulers and patriotic writers, have no
more effect in reviving public spirit, than the attraction
of a meteor in raising a tide.</p>

<p>Men, who embraced revolution principles, because
independence might save a few shillings in taxes, or extend
the imaginary sphere of freedom; who expected
that peace would place them in a paradise of blessings,
where they might riot without the fatigue of exertion;
such men had narrow views of the consequence of detaching
America from a transatlantic jurisdiction. They
viewed but a small part of the great event: They are,
they <i>ought to be</i> disappointed. Such men expect effects
without causes, and are ready to despond, or
commence enemies to a glorious event, because miracles
are not wrought to verify their ill founded predictions.</p>

<p>In this view, this insect view of things, the revolution
ought to be considered as extremely unfortunate;
for to the present generation, it must certainly prove so.</p>

<p>But on the general scale of human happiness, every
man of reflection must rejoice at the illustrious event.
Even the propriety of the independence of these States,
is so obviously dictated by their local situation, that a
generous European ought to have consented to the
measure on this single principle. But taking into consideration
the vast field which is here opened for improvements
in science, in government, in religion, and
in morals; the philosopher will felicitate himself
with the prospect of discoveries favorable to arts and
happiness; the statesman will rejoice that there is a retreat
from the vassalage of Europe; the divine will
bless God that a place has been reserved for an uncorrupted
church; and the philanthropist, who compares
the yeomanry of America with the peasantry of Europe,
will congratulate himself on an event which has
removed millions of people from the ambition of
princes, and from a participation of the vices, which
mark the decline of nations.</p>

<p>The revolution of America, whatever may be the
present effects, must, on the universal scale of policy,
<span class="pb" id="Pg084">[pg 084]</span>
prove fortunate, not only for the parties, but for mankind
in general. The period, however, when this
country will realize the happy consequences of her separation,
must be remote; probably beyond the lives of
the present generation.</p>

<p>It is worth our curiosity to inquire into the causes of
our present political evils; not the more obvious causes,
which every man sees and laments, but those radical
causes which lie hid from common observation; whose
operations are imperceptible, but whose effects are visible,
even to a vulgar eye.</p>

<p>A fundamental mistake of the Americans has been,
that they considered the revolution as completed, when
it was but just begun. Having raised the pillars of the
building, they ceased to exert themselves, and seemed
to forget that the whole superstructure was then to be
erected. This country is independent in government;
but totally dependent in manners, which are the basis
of government. Men seem not to attend to the difference
between Europe and America, in point of age
and improvement; and are disposed to rush, with heedless
emulation, into an imitation of manners, for which
we are not prepared.</p>

<p>Every person tolerably well versed in history, knows
that nations are often compared to individuals and to
vegetables, in their progress from their origin to maturity
and decay. The resemblance is striking and
just. This progress is as certain in nations as in vegetables;
it is as obvious, and its causes more easily understood;
in proportion as the secret springs of action
in government are more easily explained, than the mechanical
principles of vegetation.</p>

<p>This progress therefore being assumed as a conceded
fact, suggests a forcible argument against the introduction
of European manners into America. The business
of men in society is, first, to secure their persons
and estates by arms and wholesome laws; then to procure
the conveniences of life by arts and labor; but it
is in the last stages only of national improvement, when
luxury and amusements become public benefits, by
<span class="pb" id="Pg085">[pg 085]</span>
dissipating accumulations of wealth, and furnishing
employment and food for the poor. And luxury then
is not beneficial, except when the wealth of a nation is
wasted within itself. It is perhaps always true, that an
old civilized nation cannot, with propriety, be the model
for an infant nation, either in morals, in manners or
fashions, in literature or in government.</p>

<p>The present ambition of Americans is, to introduce
as fast as possible, the fashionable amusements of the
European courts. Considering the former dependence
of America on England, her descent, her connexion
and present intercourse, this ambition cannot surprise
us. But it must check this ambition to reflect on the
consequences. It will not be denied, that there are
vices predominant in the most polite cities in Europe,
which are not only unknown, but are seldom mentioned
in America; and vices that are infamous beyond
conception. I presume it will not be denied that there
must be an amazing depravation of mind in a nation,
where a farce is a publication of more consequence
than Milton's Poem; and where an opera dancer, or
an Italian singer, receives a salary equal to that of an
Ambassador. The facts being known and acknowleged,
I presume the consequence will not be denied.
Not that this charge is good against every individual;
even in the worst times, there will be found many exceptions
to the general character of a nation.</p>

<p>If these vices and the depravation of mind do actually
exist, it is a proof of a gradual corruption; for there
was a time when they did not exist. There was a
time when decency was a virtue, even at Venice. The
progress is also slow, unless hastened by some external
circumstances. It was more than two thousand years
from the building of Rome to the pontificate of Alexander
the VIth whose naked revelings filled the measure
of public vice, and strike the human mind with
horror.</p>

<p>A constant increase of wealth is ever followed by a
multiplication of vices: This seems to be the destiny of
human affairs; wisdom, therefore, directs us to retard,
<span class="pb" id="Pg086">[pg 086]</span>
if possible, and not to accelerate the progress of corruption.
But an introduction of the fashionable diversions
of Europe into America, is an acceleration of the
growth of vices which are yet in their infancy, and an
introduction of new ones too infamous to be mentioned.
A dancing school among the Tuscaroras, is not a
greater absurdity than a masquerade in America. A
theater, under the best regulations, is not essential to
our public and private happiness. It may afford entertainment
to individuals; but it is at the expense of
private taste and public morals. The great misfortune
of all exhibitions of this kind is this; that they reduce
all taste to a level. Not only the vices of all classes of
people are brought into view, but of all ages and nations.
The intrigues of a nobleman, and the scurrility
of shoe blacks, are presented to the view of both sexes,
of all ages; the vices of the age of Elizabeth and of
Charles IId are recorded by the masterly pens of a
Shakespeare and a Congreve, and by repeated representation,
they are "hung on high," as the poet expresses
it, "to poison half mankind." The fact is,
that all characters must be presented upon a theater,
because all characters are spectators; and a nobleman
and a sailor, a dutchess and a washer woman, that attend
constantly on the exhibitions of vice, become
equally depraved; their tastes will be nearly alike as to
vice; the one is as prepared for a crime as the other.
It is for this reason, that many of the amusements of
nations more depraved than ourselves, are highly pernicious
in this country. They carry us forward by
hasty strides, to the last stages of corruption; a period
that every benevolent man will deprecate and endeavor
to retard. This circumstance, the difference in the
stages of our political existence, should make us shun
the vices which may be politic and even necessary in
older states; and endeavor to preserve our manners by
being our own standards. By attaching ourselves to
foreign manners, we counteract the good effects of the
revolution, or rather render them incomplete. A revolution
in the form of government, is but a revolution
<span class="pb" id="Pg087">[pg 087]</span>
in name; unless attended with a change of principles
and manners, which are the springs of government.</p>

<p>This leads me to treat more particularly of the influence
of fashions on the interests of these States; an
article in which the ladies are deeply interested.</p>

<p>Fashion in itself is a matter of indifference, as affecting
neither morals nor politeness. It is of no consequence
whether a lady is clad with a gown or a frock;
or whether a gentleman appears in public with a cap or
a wig. But there may be times and situations in which
the most trifling things become important. The practice
of imitating foreign modes of dress, cannot cost
America less than 100,000l. a year. I speak not of the
necessary articles of dress; but merely of changes of
fashions.</p>

<p>To understand this fact, it is necessary to advert to
the different circumstances of this country, and of the
European kingdoms, which we take as our models.</p>

<p>Two circumstances distinguish most of the commercial
countries of Europe from America; a feudal
division of real property, and manufactures. Where
vast estates are hereditary and unalienable, a great part
of the people are dependent on the rich, and if the rich
do not employ them, they must starve. Thus in England
and France, a great landholder possesses a hundred
times the property that is necessary for the subsistence
of a family; and each landlord has perhaps a hundred
families dependent on him for subsistence. On this
statement, if the landlord should live penuriously, and
supply his own family only with necessaries, all his dependents
must starve. In order to subsist the ninety
nine families, he must create wants, which their employment
must supply; for the natural wants of a few
rich people will not furnish employment for great multitudes
of poor. Hence the good policy, the necessity
of luxury in most European kingdoms. Hence originate
all the changes and varieties of fashion. A gentleman
or lady in London must not appear in public
twice in the same suit. This is a regulation of custom,
but it is highly political; for were the nobility and
<span class="pb" id="Pg088">[pg 088]</span>
rich gentry to wear out all their clothes, one half the
people must be beggars. The fashions of England and
France are not merely matter of fancy: Fancy may
dictate new and odd figures in dress; but the general
design of frequent and continual changes of fashion, is
wise systematic policy, at the courts of London and
Paris.</p>

<p>But let us see with how little discretion and policy
<i>we</i> adopt foreign luxuries. America is a young country,
with small inequalities of property, and without
manufactures. Few people are here dependent on the
rich, for every man has an opportunity of becoming
rich himself. Consequently few people are supported
by the luxuries of the wealthy; and even these few are
mostly foreigners.</p>

<p>But we have no body of manufacturers to support by
dissipation. All our superfluities are imported, and
the consumption of them in this country enriches the
merchants and supports the poor of Europe. We are
generous indeed! generous to a fault. This is the
pernicious, the fatal effect of our dependence on foreign
nations for our manners. We labor day and night,
we sacrifice our peace and reputation, we defraud our
public creditors, involve ourselves in debts, impoverish
our country: Nay, many are willing to become bankrupts
and take lodgings in a prison, for the sake of being
as foolish as those nations which subsist their poor and
grow rich and respectable by their follies.</p>

<p>No objection can be made to rich and elegant dresses
among people of affluent circumstances. But perhaps
we may safely calculate that one third of the expenses
incurred by dress in this country, add nothing either to
convenience or elegance.</p>

<p>A new dress is invented in London or Paris, not for
the sake of superior elegance, because it frequently happens
that a new dress is less rich and elegant than an
old one; but for the sake of giving food to manufacturers.
That new fashion is sent across the Atlantic;
let it be ever so troublesome and uncouth, we admire
its novelty; we adopt it because it is fashionable; and
<span class="pb" id="Pg089">[pg 089]</span>
merely for a change, that may be made in half an hour
by a tailor or a milliner, 20, 30, or 50,000 pounds are
drawn from the capital stocks of property in America,
to enrich nations which command our commerce and
smile at our folly.</p>

<p>But it is not only the wealth of this country that is
sacrificed by our servile imitation of other nations; our
complaisance often requires us to dispense with good
taste.</p>

<p>It will probably be admitted that amidst the infinite
variety of dresses which are fashionable, during a course
of ten or fifteen years, some of them must be more
convenient and elegant than others. True taste in
dress consists in setting off the person to the best advantage.
That dress which unites the articles of convenience,
simplicity and neatness, in the greatest perfection,
must be considered as the most elegant. But
true taste goes farther; it has reference to age, to
shape, to complexion, and to the season of the year.
The same dress which adorns a miss of fifteen, will be
frightful on a venerable lady of seventy. The same
dress will embellish one lady and disfigure another.
But the passive disposition of Americans in receiving
every mode that is offered them, sometimes reduces all
ages, shapes and complexions to a level.</p>

<p>I will not undertake to say that people ought not, in
the article of dress, to sacrifice taste to national interest.
A sacrifice of that kind, in a manufacturing country,
may be laudable; it will at least be pardonable. But
in a reverse of situation, in America, where a waste of
property and a group of political evils accompany a bad
taste, the sacrifice admits of no apology.</p>

<p>It is not unfrequent to hear ladies complain severely of
the inconvenience of fashion. Their good sense disapproves
and their taste revolts at incumbrances. And
yet where is the lady who would not sooner submit to
any fatigue, rather than be ridiculous. I speak of ladies
particularly; in point of expense, the gentlemens'
dresses are exceptionable as well as the ladies; in point
of convenience, the ladies are the greatest sufferers by
<span class="pb" id="Pg090">[pg 090]</span>
fashion, as their dress admits of the greatest variety of
incumbrances.</p>

<p>Perhaps the trouble of conforming entirely to the
fashions of Europe is as great a tax upon the ladies,
as the expense is to their husbands and parents.</p>

<p>One society of people, the Friends, are happily released
from the tyranny and inconveniencies of fashion.
However disagreeable the restraints of their religion
may appear in other respects, it must be acknowledged
that, in point of dress, the rules of their society conform
to purity of taste.</p>

<p>Perhaps we may safely estimate, that the ladies of
that society dress with two thirds of the expense which
other ladies incur, even when the articles of their dress
are equally rich and expensiv; the difference is saved by
neglecting superfluous finery. And are not their taste
in dress, their simplicity and neatness, universally admired?
Does it not set off their persons to the best advantage?
Do not gentlemen almost universally give
the preference to the taste of Quaker ladies? Nay, I
would ask, whether other ladies themselves, under a
strong bias in favor of a tawdry dress, are not frequently
lavishing encomiums on the superior elegance
and convenience of the Friends' dresses? And how often
do they sigh beneath the trouble of their own dress,
and wish that particular articles would go out of fashion.</p>

<p>If there is any thing on earth, which can make a rational
mind disgusted with society, it is that cruel necessity,
which obliges a person to sacrifice both his interest
and his taste, or run the hazard of being laughed
at for his singularity.</p>

<p>In some Asiatic countries, people never change their
modes of dress. This uniformity, which continues
for ages, proceeds from the same principles as the
monthly changes in England and France; both proceed
from necessity and policy. Both arise from good
causes which operate in the several governments; that
is, the manners of each government are subservient to
its particular interest. The reverse is true of this
<span class="pb" id="Pg091">[pg 091]</span>
country. Our manners are wholly subservient to the
interest of foreign nations. Where do we find, in
dress or equipage, the least reference to the circumstances
of this country! Is it not the sole ambition of the
Americans to be just like other nations, without the
means of supporting the resemblance? We ought not
to harbor any spleen or prejudice against foreign kingdoms.
This would be illiberal. They are wise, they
are respectable. We should despise the man that
piques himself on his own country, and treats all others
with indiscriminate contempt. I wish to see much
less jealousy and ill nature subsisting between the Americans
and English. But in avoiding party spirit and
resentment on the one hand, we should be very careful
of servility on the other. There is a manly pride in
true independence, which is equally remote from insolence
and meanness; a pride that is characteristic of
great minds. Have Americans discovered this pride
since the declaration of peace? We boast of independence,
and with propriety. But will not the same men,
who glory in this great event, even in the midst of a
gasconade, turn to a foreigner and ask him, "what is
the latest fashion in Europe!" He has worn an elegant
suit of clothes for six weeks; he might wear it a
few weeks longer, but it has not so many buttons as the
last suit of my lord &mdash;&mdash;: He throws it aside, and gets
one that has. The suit costs him a sum of money;
but it keeps him in the fashion, and feeds the poor of
Great Britain or France. It is a singular phenomenon,
and to posterity it will appear incredible, that a
nation of heroes, who have conquered armies, and raised
an empire, should not have the spirit to say&mdash;<i>we will
wear our clothes as we please</i>.</p>

<p>Let it not be thought that this is a trifling subject;
a matter of no consequence. Mankind are governed
by opinion; and while we flatter ourselves that we enjoy
independence, because no foreign power can impose
laws upon us, we are groaning beneath the tyranny of
opinion; a tyranny more severe than the laws of monarchs;
a dominion voluntary indeed, but for that reason,
<span class="pb" id="Pg092">[pg 092]</span>
more effectual; an authority of manners which
commands our services, and sweeps away the fruits of
our labor.</p>

<p>I repeat the sentiment with which I began; the revolution
of America is yet incomplete. We are now in
a situation to answer all the purposes of the European
nations; independent in government, and dependent
in manners. They give us their fashions, they direct
<i>our</i> taste to make a market for <i>their</i> commodities; they
engross the profits of our industry, without the hazard
of defending us, or the expense of supporting our civil
government. A situation more favorable to <i>their</i> interest,
or more repugnant to our <i>own</i>, <i>they</i> could not
have chosen for us, nor <i>we</i> embraced.</p>

<p>If such is the state of facts, and if the influence of
foreign manners does actually defeat the purposes of
the revolution; if our implicit submission to the prevailing
taste of European courts, involves individuals
and the public in unnecessary expenses, it is in the
power of a few influential characters in each of our
commercial cities to remedy the whole evil. And in a
reformation of this kind, the ladies would have no inconsiderable
share.</p>

<p>It is really a matter of astonishment, that the pride
of the Americans has so long submitted tamely to a
foreign yoke. Aside of all regard to interest, we should
expect that the idea of being a nation of apes would
mortify minds accustomed to freedom of thought, and
would prompt them to spurn their chains.</p>

<p>Have the ladies in America no ingenuity, no taste?
Do they not understand what dresses are most convenient
and elegant? What modes are best adapted to
the climate, or other circumstances of this country?
They most certainly do. Foreigners acknowlege that
the nativ beauty and understanding of the American
ladies are not excelled in any country, and equalled in
very few. And one would imagin that the modes of
embellishing so many personal charms ought not, in all
cases, to be prescribed by the milliners and manteau
makers on the other side of the Atlantic. A noble
<span class="pb" id="Pg093">[pg 093]</span>
pride should forbid that ladies of birth and breeding
should be wholly indebted to the taste of others, for
the decorations of their beauty.</p>

<p>When the gentlemen in America shall exercise spirit
enough to be their own judges of taste in dress: When
they have wisdom to consult the circumstances of this
country, and fortitude enough to retain a fashion as
long as their <i>own interest</i> requires, instead of changing
it when <i>other nations</i> direct: When the ladies shall
exercise the rights of their sex, and say, we will <i>give</i>
the laws of fashion to our <i>own nation</i>, instead of <i>receiving</i>
them from <i>another</i>, we will perform our part of the
revolution: When both sexes shall take more pride
and pleasure in being their own standards, than in being
the humble imitators of those who riot on the
profits of our commerce; we shall realize a new species
of independence; an independence flattering to
generous minds, and more productive of wealth than
all the laws of power, or the little arts of national policy.
And in this revolution of manners, there needs
not any sacrifice of real dress. I will venture to estimate,
that the retrenching of superfluous articles; articles
which constitute no part of dress, and serve but
to disfigure an elegant person; articles that are made
and sent to us to support the sixpenny day laborers of
Europe; I say, a retrenching of these trifling articles
only, would be an annual saving to America sufficient
to pay one half of the interest of our federal debt. We
can throw no blame on foreign nations; they are wise,
and profit by our want of spirit and taste.</p>

<p>On the footing that all mankind are brethren, perhaps
it is generous in us to assist foreigners, who are a
part of the Great Family.</p>

<p>It is to be wished, however, that we might first discharge
our honest debts: That the soldier, whose labor
and blood have purchased our empire, and whose services
have been repaid with a shadow of reward, might
be indemnified by the justice of his country: That the
widow and orphan might at least receive the stipulated
satisfaction for losses which money cannot repair. Yes,
<span class="pb" id="Pg094">[pg 094]</span>
let us first be <i>just</i>, and then <i>generous</i>. When we have
no better use for our superfluous property, then let us
bestow it upon our wretched brethren of the human
race. They will repay our charity with gratitude, and
bless God that he has peopled one half the world with
a race of freemen, to enrich the tyrants, and support
the vassals of the other.</p>

<p>In another particular, our dependence on nations farther
advanced in society than ourselves, has a very unhappy
effect.</p>

<p>I assume it as a fact, conceded by all philosophers
and historians, that there has been, in every civilized
nation, a particular period of time, peculiarly favorable
to literary researches; and that in this period, language
and taste arrive to purity; the best authors flourish,
and genius is exerted to benefit mankind.</p>

<p>This period in Greece was the age of Themistocles,
immediately after the invasion of Xerxes. In Rome,
it was the reign of Augustus CÃ¦sar, when a revolution
had left the empire in a state of tranquillity. In France,
the reign of Louis the XIVth was distinguished for the
number and eminence of its authors, and the correctness
of taste. The corresponding period of taste in
England, commenced about the middle of the sixteenth
century, and ended with the reign of George the IId.
Scotland was later in improvement; but perhaps has
now seen its meridian splendor.</p>

<p>There seems to be a certain point of improvement
beyond which every step in refinement is corruption;
moral sentiment is postponed to wit, and sense is sacrificed
to sound. This has been the case in all nations, and
is now true of England. The candid among the nation
acknowlege and lament the decline of true taste and science.
Very few valuable writings appear in the present
age; plays, novels, farces, and compilations fill the
catalogue of new publications; and the library of a
man of fashion consists of Chesterfield's Letters, Tristram
Shandy, and a few comedies.</p>

<p>A gentleman in high office in London, in a letter to
an eminent literary character in America, which I had
<span class="pb" id="Pg095">[pg 095]</span>
the honor to read, informs, "that so low is the taste of
the nation, that were Milton's Poem to be now first
published, it would not find purchasers: Music and
painting are the only arts that have royal encouragement."
He says further, "that there is a national
combination to oppose the fame of every American
art, production and character." I would hope that
this account is an exaggeration of the truth; but we
have the best testimony to convince us that every thing
is sacrificed to amusement and pleasure.</p>

<p>We ought not therefore to form our taste after such
models: In order to write, think and act with propriety,
we should go back half a century, to the style and
morality of Addison and his cotemporaries; there we
may find the most perfect models.</p>

<p>By making the present taste of Europe our standards,
we not only debase our own, but we check the attempts
of genius in this country.</p>

<p>Eminence is sometimes apt to impose errors upon
people, whose respect for the character may silence all
scruple, and prevent them from examining into the
grounds of his opinion. Such is the implicit confidence
reposed in the opinions of certain celebrated
writers, that when an American ventures to call in
question a received principle or opinion of theirs, his
countrymen charge him with arrogance, and exclaim,
how should this man be as good a judge of the subject
as a foreigner! Such false notions of the perfection of
particular character, fetter the mind, and in concert
with credulity and idleness, prepare it for the reception
of any errors, however enormous.</p>

<p>This same veneration for eminent foreigners, and
the bewitching charms of fashion, have led the Americans
to adopt the modern corruptions of our language.
Very seldom have men examined the structure of the
language, to find reasons for their practice. The pronunciation
and use of words have been subject to the
same arbitrary or accidental changes, as the shape of
their garments. My lord wears a hat of a certain size
and shape; he pronounces a word in a certain manner;
<span class="pb" id="Pg096">[pg 096]</span>
and both must be right, for he is a fashionable
man. In Europe this is right in dress; and men who
have not an opportunity of learning the just rules of
our language, are in some degree excuseable for imitating
those whom they consider as superiors. But in
men of science, this imitation can hardly be excused.</p>

<p>Our language was spoken in purity about eighty years
ago; since which time, great numbers of faults have
crept into practice about the theater and court of London.
An affected erroneous pronunciation has in
many instances taken place of the true; and new words
or modes of speech have succeeded the ancient correct
English phrases.</p>

<p>Thus we have, in the modern English pronunciation,
their natshures, conjunctshures, constitshutions, and
tshumultshuous legislatshures; and a long catalogue of
fashionable improprieties. These are a direct violation
of the rules of analogy and harmony; they offend
the ear, and embarrass the language. Time was,
when these errors were unknown; they were little
known in America before the revolution. I presume
we may safely say, that our language has suffered more
injurious changes in America, since the British army
landed on our shores, than it had suffered before, in the
period of three centuries. The bucks and bloods tell
us that there is no proper standard in language; that
it is all arbitrary. The assertion, however, serves but
to show their ignorance. There are, in the language
itself, decisive reasons for preferring one pronunciation
to another; and men of science should be acquainted
with these reasons. But if there were none, and every
thing rested on practice, we should never change a general
practice without substantial reasons: No change
should be introduced, which is not an obvious improvement.</p>

<p>But our leading characters seem to pay no regard to
rules, or their former practice. To know and embrace
every change made in Great Britain, whether
right or wrong, is the extent of their inquiries, and the
height of their ambition. It is to this deference we
<span class="pb" id="Pg097">[pg 097]</span>
may ascribe the long catalogue of errors in pronunciation
and of false idioms which disfigure the language
of our mighty fine speakers. And should this imitation
continue, we shall be hurried down the stream of
corruption, with older nations, and our language, with
theirs, be lost in an ocean of perpetual changes. The
only hope we can entertain is, that America, driven by
the shock of a revolution, from the rapidity of the current,
may glide along near the margin with a gentler
stream, and sometimes be wafted back by an eddy.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks suggest some of the causes
which operate to defeat the true end of the revolution.
Every man sees and feels our political embarrassments;
the foes of the revolution ascribe them all to that event,
and the friends charge them upon the enmity and resentment
of our parent country. Both are wrong.
The revolution is, and will ultimately prove, a happy
event for us and for the world. The English, as a
nation, are wise and respectable: As citizens of the
world, we should esteem them: As a commercial people,
we should cultivate a friendly intercourse with
them; but as a foreign nation, whose political circumstances
are very different from ours, we should not
make them, in all cases, our standard. I repeat the
declaration I before made: The independence of this
country is incomplete: There has been a total change
in government, with little or no change in the principles
which give energy to the operations of government.</p>

<p>In the preceding remarks, I have endeavored to shew
in what respect the revolution of America is yet incomplete,
and that an independence of manners and
opinion is necessary to give full effect to an independence
of government. I propose now to make some
remarks on government, to state the effects of the revolution
on the morals of people, and the influence of
money on mens' sense of justice and moral obligation.</p>

<p>It is perhaps a fundamental principle of government,
that men are influenced more by habit, than by any
abstract ideas of right and wrong. Few people examin
<span class="pb" id="Pg098">[pg 098]</span>
into the propriety of particular usages or laws; or if
they examin, few indeed are capable of comprehending
their propriety. But every man knows what is a law
or general practice, and he conforms to it, not because
it is right or best, but because it has been the practice.
It is for this reason that habits of obedience should not
be disturbed. There are perhaps in every government,
some laws and customs, which, when examined
on theoretical principles, will be found unjust and even
impolitic. But if the people acquiesce in those laws
and customs, if they are attached to them by habit, it is
wrong in the Legislature to attempt an innovation which
shall alarm their apprehensions. There are multitudes
of absurdities practised in society, in which people are
evidently happy. Arraign those absurdities before the
tribunal of examination; people may be convinced of
their impropriety; they may even be convinced that
better schemes may be projected; and yet it might be
impossible to unite their opinions so as to establish different
maxims. On the other hand, there are many
good institutions, in which, however, there may be theoretical
faults, which, if called into public view, and
artfully represented, might shake the best government
on earth.</p>

<p>Speculativ philosophers and historians have often
described, and sometimes ridiculed the warmth with
which nations have defended errors in religion and
government. With the most profound deference for
wise and respectable men, I must think they are guilty
of a mistake; and that the errors which nations fight
to defend, exist only in the heads of these theorists.
Whatever speculation may tell us, experience and the
peace of society, require us to consider every thing as
right, which a nation believes to be so. Every institution,
every custom, may be deemed just and proper,
which does not produce inconveniencies that the bulk
of mankind may see and feel. The tranquillity of society
therefore should never be disturbed for a philosophical
distinction.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg099">[pg 099]</span>
It will perhaps be objected, that these doctrines, if
practised, would prevent all improvements, in science,
religion and government. By no means; but they
point out the method in which all improvements
should be made, when opinion and fixed habits are to
be overthrown, or changed. They show that all reformation
should be left to the natural progress of society,
or to the conviction of the mind. They show
the hazard and impracticability of making changes, before
the minds of the body of the people are prepared
for the innovation. I speak not of despotic governments,
where the will of the prince is enforced by an
army; and yet even absolute tyrants have been assassinated
for not attending to the spirit and habits of their
subjects.</p>

<p>In vain do rulers oppose the general opinion of the
people. By such opposition, Philip IId, of Spain,
kept one part of his subjects, for half a century, butchering
the other, and in the end, lost one third of his
dominions. By not regarding the change of habits in
the nation, Charles Ist, of England, lost his head. By
carrying his changes too far, Cromwell began to oppose
the spirit of the nation, and had he lived to prosecute
his system, that spirit would, in a few years, have
brought his neck to the block. The general spirit of
the nation restored to the throne, the son of the prince,
whom that spirit had but a few years before arraigned
and condemned. By opposing that spirit, James was
obliged to leave his kingdom, and the sense of the nation
still excludes the family which, by their own law
of succession, has the best title to the throne. But
there is no prescription against general opinion; no
right that can enter the list against the sense of a nation;
that sense, which after all our reasoning, will forever
determin what is best.</p>

<p>The truth of these remarks is proved by examples in
this country. An immense revenue might have been
drawn from America without resistance, in almost any
method but that which the British parliament adopted.
But their first attempts were made upon articles of
<span class="pb" id="Pg100">[pg 100]</span>
common necessity; the attempts were too visible; the
people felt and resisted. Their apprehensions were alarmed;
their fears, whether well founded or imaginary,
were multiplied and confirmed by newspaper rhapsodies,
and finally produced a combined opposition to all
British taxation. Then Great Britain should have
compounded; she did not; she opposed the general
sense of three millions of her subjects, and lost the
whole.</p>

<p>A dispute existed between Connecticut and Pensylvania,
respecting a tract of land; a federal court decided
the jurisdiction, or State claim, in favor of Pensylvania;
five thousand inhabitants, seated on the lands, acknowlege
the jurisdiction, but contend that their
original purchase, and subsequent labor, entitle them to
the lands. Notwithstanding the invalidity of their
State claim, the settlers determin to maintain their
lands. The question of right is at once suspended,
and the only inquiry is, which is the best policy, to
indemnify a few individuals by a pecuniary composition,
or sacrifice five thousand subjects. This question,
left to the commonwealth, would be decided by a great
majority, in favor of the settlers, and against the very
principles of right on which the State holds the jurisdiction.</p>

<p>I am not competent to judge of the merits of the
dispute between New York and Vermont; but if the
usurpation of Vermont were a conceded fact, and that
usurpation to be defended by arms, and the question of
granting them independence were left to the State of
New York, I am confident that nine tenths of the people
would decide for the independence of Vermont
against their own rights.</p>

<p>Thus it often happens, that a general opinion,
grounded on rational expediency, will, and ought to
decide political questions, contrary to the strict principles
of justice and equity.</p>

<p>I would, by no means, be understood to defend, by
such doctrines, the insurrections of a neighboring State.
I reprobate every thing that wears the least appearance
<span class="pb" id="Pg101">[pg 101]</span>
of opposition to lawful authority. It is evident however,
that the Legislature of Massachusetts were too
inattentive to the general spirit of the State. The
murmurs of the people were heard long before they
broke out into rebellion, and were treated with too
much neglect. They were a proof at least that something
was wrong. This the Legislature acknowleged
in their late acts, and the complaints of the populace
might once have been silenced by such conciliatory
measures.</p>

<p>But an opposition so violent must suddenly cease, or
acquire system. In the latter case, the demands of the
insurgents will rise in proportion to their strength; they
will ask unreasonable concessions, and the sword must
decide their claims. The insurgents took wrong
steps to obtain redress; they should have rested their
agrievances on petitions, and the event of an election;
but one rash step leads to a second, and to a third. These
fatal effects of popular discontent afford one useful lesson,
that rulers should not attempt to carry a measure
against the general voice of a people.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" title="Some have suspected from these sentiments, that I favor the insurrection in Massachusetts. If it is necessary to be more explicit than I have been in the declaration, 'I reprobate, &amp;c.' I must add, that in governments like ours, derived from the people, I believe there is no possible situation in which violent opposition to laws can be justified; because it can never be necessary. General evils will always be legally redressed, and partial evils must be borne, if the majority require it...." class="fnanchor">[35]</a> But a question
will arise, how far may the people be opposed, when
their schemes are evidently pernicious? I answer, this
can never happen thro design; and errors, even of
the populace, may gradually be removed. If the people
cannot be convinced, by reason and argument, of
the impolicy or injustice of a favorite scheme, we have
only to wait for the consequences to produce conviction.
All people are not capable of just reasoning on
the great scale of politics; but all can feel the inconveniencies
<span class="pb" id="Pg102">[pg 102]</span>
of wrong measures, and evils of this kind generally
furnish their own remedy. All popular Legislatures
are liable to great mistakes. Many of the acts
of the American Legislatures, respecting money and
commerce, will, to future generations, appear incredible.
After repeated experiments, people will be better
informed, and astonished that their fathers could make
such blunders in legislation.</p>

<p>If the people of this State<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" title="Pensylvania." class="fnanchor">[36]</a> are not already convinced,
they certainly will be, that the addition of 150,000l.
of paper, to the current specie of the State, did not increase
the permanent value of circulating medium a
single farthing. They were perhaps told that such a
sum of paper would shut up the specie, or enable the
merchant to export it; but their jealousy made them
believe these the suggestions of interest; and nothing
but the experiment could satisfy their wishes. Every
man of reflection must regret that he is subject to the
evils consequent on popular mistakes in judgement; but
this is the price of our independence and our forms of
government.</p>

<p>Let us attend to the immediate and necessary consequences
of the American revolution.</p>

<p>So great an event as that of detaching millions of
people from their parent nation, could not have been
effected without the operation of powerful causes.
Nothing but a series of real or imaginary evils could
have shaken the habits by which we were governed,
and produced a combined opposition against the power
of Great Britain. I shall not enumerate any of these
evils; but observe that such evils, by twenty years operation
upon the fears or feelings of the Americans,
had alienated their affections or weakened those habits
of respect, by which they were predisposed to voluntary
obedience. When a government has lost respect, it
has lost the main pillar of its authority. Not even a
military force can supply the want of respect among
subjects. A change of sentiment prepares the way for
a change of government, and when that change of sentiment
<span class="pb" id="Pg103">[pg 103]</span>
had become general in America, nothing could
have prevented a revolution.</p>

<p>But it is more easy to excite fears than to remove
them. The jealousy raised in the minds of Americans
against the British government, wrought a revolution;
but the spirit did not then subside; it changed its object,
and by the arts of designing men, and the real distresses
consequent on such a political storm, was directed
against our own governments. The restraints imposed
by respect and habits of obedience were broken
thro, and the licentious passions of men set afloat.</p>

<p>Nothing can be so fatal to morals and the peace of
society, as a violent shock given to public opinion or
fixed habits. Polemic disputes have often destroyed
the friendship of a church, and filled it, not only with
rancor, but with immorality. Public opinion therefore
in religion and government, the great supports of
society, should never be suddenly unhinged. The separation
of America, however, from all dependence on
European government, could not have been effected
without previously attacking and changing opinion. It
was an essential step, but the effects of it will not easily
be repaired. That independence of spirit which preceded
the commencement of hostilities, and which victory
has strengthened; that love of dominion, inherent
in the mind of man, which our forms of government
are continually flattering; that licentiousness of inquiry
which a jealousy of rights first produced and still preserves,
cannot be controled and subdued, but by a long
series of prudent and vigorous measures.</p>

<p>Perhaps the present age will hardly see the restoration
of perfect tranquillity. But the spirit and principles,
which wrought our separation from Great Britain, will
mostly die with the present generation; the next generation
will probably have new habits of obedience to
our new governments; and habits will govern them,
with very little support from law.</p>

<p>The force of habit in government is most strikingly
illustrated by the example of Connecticut. Most of
the laws, customs and institutions, which the people
<span class="pb" id="Pg104">[pg 104]</span>
brought with them from England, or which they introduced,
on their first settlement, remain to this day,
with such small alterations only as would naturally be
made in the progress of society and population.</p>

<p>The government of Connecticut had formerly little
more than a nominal dependence on England; independence
therefore required but a little change of the
old constitution. The habits of the people have not
been materially changed; their respect for the government
has not been suspended nor diminished. It
would therefore be extremely difficult to raise an insurrection
in that State against their own government;<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" title="This assertion may seem to be contradicted by the opposition of Connecticut to the half pay act; but that opposition did not even threaten violence or arms: It was conducted in a peaceable manner; and I do not know that the State has furnished an instance of a tumultuous interruption of law." class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
for they have not been accustomed to dispute the propriety
of their established maxims and laws. Whatever
alterations in their constitution, a discerning Legislator
might suggest, it would be highly impolitic to
attempt any changes, which should disturb public
opinion or alarm apprehension. When a law or custom
becomes inconvenient, the people will feel the evil
and apply a remedy.</p>

<p>Most of the other States had new constitutions of
government to form; they had a kind of interregnum;
an interval, when respect for all government was suspended;
an interval fatal in the last degree, to morals
and social confidence. This interval between the abolition
of the old constitution and the formation of a
new one, lasted longer in Massachusetts than in the other
States, and there the effects are most visible. But perhaps
it is impossible to frame a constitution of government,
in the closet, which will suit the people; for it is
frequent to find one, the most perfect in theory, the
most objectionable in practice. Hence we often hear
popular complaints against the present governments in
America: And yet these may proceed rather from the
novelty of the obedience required, than from any real
<span class="pb" id="Pg105">[pg 105]</span>
errors or defects in the systems: It may be nothing
but the want of habit which makes people uneasy; the
same articles which now produce clamors and discontent,
may, after twenty years practice, give perfect satisfaction.
Nay, the same civil regulation, which the
present generation may raise a mob to resist, the next
generation may raise a mob to defend.</p>

<p>But perhaps a more immediate and powerful cause
of a corruption of social principles, is a fluctuation of
money. Few people seem to attend to the connexion
between money and morals; but it may doubtless be
proved to the satisfaction of every reflecting mind, that
a sudden increase of specie in a country, and frequent
and obvious changes of value, are more fruitful sources
of corruption of morals than any events that take place
in a community.</p>

<p>America began the late war without funds of money,
and its circulating specie was very inconsiderable.
Commerce was regular, and <i>speculation</i>, a term unknown
to the body of the people.</p>

<p>The emission of paper was an obvious and necessary
expedient; yet it was bad policy to throw vast sums
into circulation without taking some measures to recall
it. It was the fate of America to receive in bills
of credit, and in the course of three or four years, about
twenty times the nominal value of its current
specie; the bills depreciated in the same proportion,
and the real value of the medium continued the same.</p>

<p>The first visible effect of an augmentation of the
medium and the consequent fluctuation of value, was,
a host of jockies, who followed a species of itinerant
commerce; and subsisted upon the ignorance and honesty
of the country people; or in other words, upon
the difference in the value of the currency, in different
places. Perhaps we may safely estimate, that not less
than 20,000 men in America, left honest callings, and
applied themselves to this knavish traffic. A sudden
augmentation of currency flattered people with the
prospect of accumulating property without labor.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg106">[pg 106]</span>
The first effect of too much money is to check
manual labor, the only permanent source of wealth.
Industry, which secures subsistence and advances our
interest by slow and regular gains, is the best preservative
of morals; for it keeps men employed, and affords
them few opportunities of taking unfair advantages.
A regular commerce has nearly the same effect as
agriculture or the mechanic arts; for the principles
are generally fixed and understood.</p>

<p>Speculation has the contrary effect. As its calculations
for profit depend on no fixed principles, but
solely on the different value of articles in different parts
of the country, or accidental and sudden variations of
value, it opens a field for the exercise of ingenuity in
taking advantage of these circumstances. The speculator
may begin with honest intentions; and may justify
his business, by saying, that he injures no man,
when he givs the current value of an article in one
place, and sells it for its current value in another; altho
in this case he is a useless member of society, as he
livs upon the labor of others, without earning a farthing.
But he does not stop here; he takes an advantage
of ignorance and necessity; he will, if possible,
monopolize an article to create a necessity. Repeated
opportunities of this kind gradually weaken
the force of moral obligation; and nine persons of ten,
who enter into the business of speculation with a good
character, will, in a few years, lose their principles, and
probably, their reputation.</p>

<p>Speculation is pernicious to morals, in proportion as
its effects are extensiv. Speculation in the English
funds is practised on principles destructiv of justice and
morals; but it consists in the transfer of large sums;
the contingencies on which it depends are not frequent,
and the business is confined to a few sharpers in the
metropolis. Such a speculation affects not the body
of the people. The medium circulating in the kingdom,
has a fixed permanent value, and affords no opportunities
for irregular gains.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg107">[pg 107]</span>
Very different is speculation in America. Here its
objects are in every person's hands; changes of value
are frequent; opportunities of gain, numberless; and
the evil pervades the community. The country
swarms with speculators, who are searching all places,
from the stores of the wealthy, to the recesses of indigence,
for opportunities of making lucrativ bargains.
Not a tavern can we enter, but we meet crowds of
these people, who wear their character in their countenances.</p>

<p>But the speculators are not the only men whose
character and principles are exposed by such a state of
the currency; the honest laborer and the regular merchant
are often tempted to forsake the established principles
of advance. Every temptation of this kind attacks
the moral principles, and exposes men to small
deviations from the rectitude of commutativ justice.</p>

<p>Such are the sources of corruption in commercial intercourse.
A relaxation of principle, in one instance,
leads to every species of vice, and operates till its causes
cease to exist, or till all the supports of social confidence
are subverted. It is remarked by people very illiterate
and circumscribed in their observation, that there is not
now the same confidence between man and man, which
existed before the war. It is doubtless true; this distrust
of individuals, a general corruption of manners,
idleness, and all its train of fatal consequences, may be
resolved into two causes: The sudden flood of money
during the late war, and a constant fluctuation of the
value of the currencies.</p>

<p>The effects of a sudden augmentation of the quantity
of money in circulation were so obvious, during the
war, and the example is so recent, that the subject requires
no illustration, but a recollection of facts. Yet
there is an example recorded in the History of France,
so exactly in point, that I cannot omit it.</p>

<p>During the regency of the Duke of Orleans, one
Law, who had fled from punishment in Scotland, and
taken refuge in France, obtained, by his address, a great
share of confidence in the councils of the regent. He
<span class="pb" id="Pg108">[pg 108]</span>
formed a plan of drawing all the specie from circulation,
and issuing bills upon the royal treasury. It is
not necessary to name the expedients he used to effect
his purpose. It is sufficient to observe, that by various
methods, he drew most of the specie of the kingdom
into the public treasury, and issued bills to about one
hundred times the value of the specie, which had before
circulated. The notes or securities depreciated as
they were thrown into circulation, like our continental
currency. The nature of a medium of trade, it seems,
was not well understood: Such a sudden depreciation
was a surprising phenomenon at that period; men of
property, who were the holders of the paper, were alarmed;
the kingdom was in confusion. When the
bills had sunk to a fifth of their value, a royal edict was
issued, ordaining that the remaining specie in circulation
should be sunk to a level with paper. This resembles,
in some respects, the regulation of prices in
America. An edict, so rash and absurd, increased the
evils it was meant to remedy, and filled the kingdom
with clamor.</p>

<p>In a short time, the paper was sunk as low as our
continental currency, before its death.</p>

<p>The confusion was general; the regent and Law
were obliged to fly the kingdom; and both died in obscurity,
the one in Italy, and the other, if I mistake not,
in the Netherlands. In France there was a total change
of property; poor men made fortunes by speculation,
and the rich were beggared. The result of the whole
was, that the paper was called in at a discount, by means
similar to the <i>forty for one</i> act of the United States.</p>

<p>But the principal view I have in stating this example
is, to show the effect of a sudden inundation of money
upon industry and morals. No sooner did the nation
feel an increase of the quantity of money, but the kingdom
was overrun with speculators; men who left useful
occupations, for the prospect of rapid accumulations
of wealth. Knavery, over reaching, idleness, prodigality,
and every kind of vice prevailed, and filled the
kingdom with distress, confusion, and poverty.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg109">[pg 109]</span>
The South Sea bubble, in England, was a farce of a
similar kind, but its effects were less extensiv.</p>

<p>The continental currency was not the sole cause of
the idleness and speculation, which prevailed in this
country, about the years 1780, 1781, and 1782. Vast
quantities of specie were introduced by the French army,
by the Spanish trade, and by a clandestine intercourse
with the British garrisons. At the close of the
war, there was more than double the quantity of gold
and silver in the country, which was necessary for the
purposes of a regular commerce.</p>

<p>This extraordinary circulation of specie had its usual,
its certain effect; it prompted multitudes to quit manual
labor for trade. This circumstance, in conjunction
with the disbanding of the army, which left great numbers
of men without employment, and with a rage for
foreign goods, which was always strong, and was then
increased by a long war, filled our commercial towns
with hosts of adventurers in business. The consequent
influx of goods and enormous credit necessary to obtain
them, are evils that deeply affect this country. I
will not attempt a detail of the state of commerce in
the United States; but observe that the necessary exportation
of specie was the happiest event that could
befal the United States; the only event that could
turn industry into its proper channel, and reduce the
commerce of the country to a proportion with the agriculture.</p>

<p>Dissipation was another consequence of a flood of
money. No country perhaps on earth can exhibit
such a spirit of dissipation among men, who derive
their support from business, as America. It is supposed
by good judges, that the expenses of subsistence,
dress and equipage, were nearly doubled in the commercial
towns, the two first years of the peace. I have
no doubt the support of the common people was enhanced
twenty five per cent. This augmentation of
expenses, with a dimunition of productiv industry, are
the consequences of too much money, and a scarcity is
our only remedy.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg110">[pg 110]</span>
Short sighted people complain of the present scarcity;
but it is the only hope of our political salvation;
and that Legislature which ventures to remove popular
complaints, by a coinage of great quantities of specie,
or by its substitute, paper, checks industry, keeps alive
a spirit of dissipation, and retards the increase of solid
wealth. If this has been necessary, it is a necessity sincerely
to be lamented.</p>

<p>But there is one source of idleness and corruption,
which is general in America, and bids fair to be of
long duration. I refer to the different species of federal
and State securities, which are every where diffused,
and of fluctuating value. These evidences of our
debts open such prospects for rapid accumulations of
property to every class of people, that men cannot withstand
the temptation: Thousands are drawn from
useful occupations into a course of life, which cannot
possibly benefit society; which must render them useless,
and probably will render them bad men, and dangerous
members of a community.</p>

<p>What remedy can be applied to so great an evil, it is
not for me to determin. But if I may offer my sentiments
freely, I must acknowlege that I think no measure
can produce so much mischief, as the circulation of
a depreciated changeable currency. Let all our debts
be placed on the footing of bank stock, and made transferable
only at the treasury; or let the present evidences
of it be called in, and new notes issued, payable only
to the creditor or original holder; or let the securities
be purchased at their current discount, let some method
be adopted to draw them from circulation; for they
destroy public and private confidence; they cut the
sinews of industry; they operate like a slow poison,
dissolving the <i>stamina</i> of government, moral principles.</p>

<p>No paper should circulate in a commercial country,
which is not a representativ of ready cash; it must at
least command punctual interest, and security of the
principal when demanded. Without these requisits,
all notes will certainly depreciate. Most of our public
securities want all the requisits of a paper currency.
<span class="pb" id="Pg111">[pg 111]</span>
But if they did not; if they were equal in value to
bank notes or specie, still the sums are much too large
for a circulating medium in America. The amount
of the continental and State certificates, with the emissions
of paper by particular States, cannot be less than
seventy millions of dollars, which is seven times the
sum necessary for a circulation.</p>

<p>Were they equal in value to gold and silver, the
whole medium would depreciate, specie as well as paper.
But as they want every requisit of a paper
currency, the whole depreciation falls upon the securities.</p>

<p>An alarming consequence of the State of our public
debt remains to be considered. Want of confidence
in the public, added to the vast quantity of paper, has
sunk it to a third, sixth, or eighth part of its nominal
value. Most of the creditors of the public have parted
with their securities at a great discount, and are thus
robbed of the monies which they earned by the sweat
of the brow. Men of property have purchased them
for a trifle, and in some States receive the interest in
specie. In Massachusetts, this is the case with respect
to some part of the State debt. When a man buys a
note of twenty shillings value for five, and receives the
interest, six per cent. in specie, he in fact receives twenty
four per cent. on his money.</p>

<p>This is one source of the insurrection in Massachusetts.
The people feel the injustice of paying such an
interest to men who earned but a small part of it, and
whose sole merit is, that they have more money than
their fellow citizens who suffer the loss by depreciation.
Those men in particular, who fought for our independence,
or loaned their property to save the country,
view with indignant resentment, that law which obliges
them to pay twenty four per cent. interest on the securities,
which they have sold for a fourth, or an eighth
part of their honest demands.</p>

<p>This cannot justify the violent steps taken by the
people; because petitions, and united firmness in a
constitutional way, would have procured redress. But
<span class="pb" id="Pg112">[pg 112]</span>
I state the facts to shew the effects of speculation, or
rather, of the want of faith in public engagements.</p>

<p>Such are the consequences of a variable medium;
neglect to industry; application to irregular commerce;
relaxation of principles in social intercourse; distrust of
individuals; loss of confidence in the public, and of
respect for laws; innumerable acts of injustice between
man and man, and between the State and the subject;
popular uneasiness, murmurs and insurrections. And
such effects will exist till their cause shall be removed.
Not the creation of a Supreme Power over the United
States, is an object of more importance, than the annihilation
of every species of fluctuating currency.</p>

<p>That instability of law, to which republics are
prone, is another source of corruption. Multiplication
and changes of law have a great effect in weakening
the force of government, by preventing or destroying
habits. Law acquires force by a steady operation,
and government acquires dignity and respect, in proportion
to the uniformity of its proceedings. Necessity
perhaps has made our federal and provincial governments
frequently shift their measures, and the unforeseen
or unavoidable variations of public securities,
with the impossibility of commanding the resources of
the continent, to fulfil engagements, all predict a continuation
of the evil. But the whole wisdom of Legislatures
should be exerted to devise a system of measures
which may preclude the necessity of changes that
tend to bring government into contempt.</p>

<p>A mild or lax execution of law may also have a bad
effect in lessening the respect for its officers. In a
monarchy, there is no reasoning with the executive;
the will of the prince inspires terror. In our governments,
the officers are often familiar, and will even delay
justice as long as possible to assist the prisoner.</p>

<p>In some of the eastern States, the frequency and
mildness of laws, have introduced very singular habits.
The people of Connecticut respect the laws as much
as any people; they would not be guilty of disobedience;
they mean generally to pay their debts, but are
<span class="pb" id="Pg113">[pg 113]</span>
not very anxious to be punctual. They suppose a
creditor can wait for his money longer than the period
when it is due, and think it hard if he will not.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" title="These remarks are not applicable to the mercantile part of the people, who, since the revolution, have been distinguished by their punctuality." class="fnanchor">[38]</a> </p>

<p>This mild execution of law, and a consequential
habit of dilatoriness, which arise from the spirit of equality,
are still prevalent amongst the body of the people.
These gave rise to the late incorporation of several
commercial towns, with large powers; an expedient
which has answered the purpose of giving to commerce
the advantage of energy and dispatch in the collection
of debts. As most of the business is done in the cities,
this effect will gradually extend itself, and form different
habits.</p>

<p>The great misfortune of the multiplicity of laws and
frequency of litigation, is, that they weaken a respect
for the executiv authority, destroy the principle of
honor, and transfer the disgrace, which ought to follow
delinquency in payment, from a man's reputation,
to the administration of justice. The lawyers and
courts are impeached, when the whole blame ought to
fall upon the debtor for his impunctuality. Honor,
a substitute for honesty, has more influence upon men
than law; for in the one case, a man's character is at
stake, and in the other, his property. When a man's
character suffers not, by a failure of engagements, and
by a public prosecution, the collection of debts must be
slow. But when a man's reputation is suspended on
the punctual discharge of his contracts, he will spare
no pains to do it; and this is or ought to be the case in
all commercial countries.</p>

<p>Extensiv credit, in a popular government, is always
pernicious, and may be fatal. When the people are
deeply or generally involved, they have power and
strong temptations to introduce an abolition of debts;
an agrarian law, or that modern refinement on the Roman
plan, which is a substitute for both, a paper currency,
issued on depreciating principles. Rhode Island
<span class="pb" id="Pg114">[pg 114]</span>
is a melancholy proof of this truth, and New Hampshire
narrowly escaped the deplorable evils. In governments
like ours, it is policy to make it the interest of people
to be honest. In short, the whole art of governing
consists in binding each individual by his particular interest,
to promote the aggregate interest of the community.</p>

<p>Massachusetts affords a striking example of the danger
incurred by too many private debts. During the
war the operation of justice was necessarily suspended,
and debts were constantly multiplying and accumulating.
When law came to be rigorously enforced, the
people were distressed beyond measure, particularly in
the western counties, where people are poorer than in
the parts of the State better settled, and nearer to market.
These private debts crowded hard, and operated
with the demands of the federal creditors, to push the
people into violent measures.</p>

<p>The planters in Virginia owe immense sums of
money to the British merchants. What is the consequence?
a law, suspending the collection of British
debts. The loss of their slaves is the ostensible excuse
for this law; but a more solid reason must be, the utter
impossibility of immediately discharging the debts. In
our governments the men who owe the money, make
the laws; and a general embarrassment of circumstances
is too strong a temptation to evade or suspend the performance
of justice. For this reason, the wisdom of
the Legislature might cooperate with the interest of the
merchant, to check a general credit. In some cases it
might be safe and wise to withdraw the protection of
law from debts of certain descriptions. It is an excellent
law in one State, which ordains, that no tavern
debt, of more than two days standing, shall be recoverable
by law. It prevents tavern haunting and its consequences,
idleness, drunkenness and quarrels. Perhaps
laws of this kind have the best effect in introducing
punctual payments. Their first effect is to prevent
credit; but they gradually change a man's regard
for his property, to a more activ and efficient principle,
an attention to his character.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg115">[pg 115]</span>
In the present anarchy in Massachusetts, monied men
get credit with the merchant, and are punctual to fulfil
engagements, as they are sensible that the merchant
relies solely on their honor. The certain ultimate
tendency of withdrawing the protection of law from
particular kinds of debts, is to discourage tricks and
evasions, and introduce habits of punctuality in commerce.</p>

<p>The present state of our public credit hath the same
effect. Repeated violations of public faith, the circulation
of a variable medium of trade, the contempt of
law, the perpetual fear of new legislativ schemes for discharging
our debts, and of tender laws, have made
men very cautious in giving credit, and when they do
give it, they depend more on the honor of a man than
on any security derived from law. This one happy
effect of want of confidence in the public, is some small
consolation for an infinite variety of political evils and
distresses.</p>

<p>Laws to prevent credit would be beneficial to poor
people. With respect to the contraction of debts,
people at large, in some measure, resemble children;
they are not judges even of their own interest. They
anticipate their incomes, and very often, by miscalculation,
much more than their incomes. But this is
not the worst effect; an easy credit throws them off
their guard in their expenses. In general we observe
that a slow, laborious acquisition of property, creates a
caution in expenditures, and gradually forms the miser.
On the other hand, a sudden acquisition of money,
either by gambling, lotteries, privateering, or marriage,
has a tendency to open the heart, or throw the man off
his guard, and thus makes him prodigal in his expenses.
Perhaps this is ever the case, except when a penurious
habit has been previously formed.</p>

<p>An easy and extensiv credit has a similar effect.
When people can possess themselves of property without
previous labor, they consume it with improvident
liberality. A prudent man will not; but a large proportion
of mankind have not prudence and fortitude
<span class="pb" id="Pg116">[pg 116]</span>
enough to resist the demands of pride and appetite.
Thus they often riot on other men's property, which
they would not labor to procure. They form habits
of indolence and extravagance, which ruin their families,
and impoverish their creditors.</p>

<p>Another effect of extensiv credit, is a multitude of
lawyers. Every thing which tends to create disputes,
to multiply debts, weaken a regard to commercial engagements,
and place the collection of debts on law,
rather than on honour, increases the encouragement of
lawyers. The profession of law is honorable, and the
professors, I scruple not to aver, as liberal, honest and
respectable, as any class of men in the State. But their
business must be considered as a public evil, except in
the drafting of legal instruments, and in some real important
disputes. Such is the habit of trusting to law,
for the recovery of debts, that, in some of the eastern
States, one half or two thirds of the lawyers are mere
collectors. They bring forward suits for small debts,
that are not disputed; they recover judgement upon
default, they take out executions, and live upon their
fees.</p>

<p>The evil is not so great in the middle States; but it
is great in all the States. Never was there such a rage
for the study of law. From one end of the continent
to the other, the students of this science are multiplying
without number. An infallible proof that the business
is lucrativ.</p>

<p>The insurgents in Massachusetts enumerate lawyers
among their grievances. They wish the Legislature to
limit their number and their demands. Short sighted
mortals! They seem not to consider that lawyers grow
out of their own follies, and that the only radical remedy
for the evil is, to contract no more debts than they
can pay, with strict punctuality.</p>

<p>The number of professional men in a State should
be as few as possible; for they do not increase the property
of the State, but liv on the property acquired by
others.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg117">[pg 117]</span>
There is little danger that the number of clergymen
will be too great. In a few instances, religious parties
may have multiplied their teachers to too great a number,
and perhaps in some parts of the country, a few
more ministers of the gospel would be very useful.</p>

<p>Physicians will multiply in proportion to the luxuries
and idleness of men. They cannot be limited by
law, for people will be as intemperate and as lazy as
they please.</p>

<p>But an artful Legislature will take away some of the
causes of litigation, and thus curtail the number of
lawyers. We may always determin the degree of corruption,
in commercial habits, by the number of civil
suits in the courts of law. The multiplication of lawyers
is a proof of private embarrassments in any State;
it is a convincing proof that in America these embarrassments
are numberless. The evil is of such magnitude
in <i>some</i> States, as to suspend the operation of law,
and in <i>all</i> it produces distrust among men, renders
property unsafe, and perplexes our mutual intercourse.
In this situation, with popular governments, and an
unbounded rage for magnificent living, perhaps the only
effectual remedy for a multitude of public evils, is
the restraining of credit. It might even be useful to
destroy all credit on the security of law, except debts of
certain descriptions, where mortgages might be given.
This would not check business, but it would oblige
people to exercise a principle of honor, and to have recourse
to industry, and ready payment for articles which
their necessities or their fancies require. We should
then be better able to determin, whether bucks and
bloods, in high life, "who roll the thundering chariot
o'er the ground," are sporting with their own property,
or that of honest creditors.</p>

<p>I cannot close these remarks without observing how
much this country owes to particular classes of people
for the practice of the commercial virtues. To the
Friends, the Germans and the Dutch, this country is
indebted for that industry and provident economy,
<span class="pb" id="Pg118">[pg 118]</span>
which enables them to subsist without anxiety, and to
be honest and punctual, without embarrassment.</p>

<p>Happy would it be for this country, if these virtues
were more generally practised. Paper money and foreign
credit are mere temporary expedients to keep up
the <i>appearance of wealth</i> and splendor; but they are miserable
substitutes for solid property. The only way to
become rich at home and respectable abroad, is to become
industrious, and to throw off our slavish dependence
on foreign manners, which obliges us to sacrifice
our opinions, our taste, and our interest, to the policy
and aggrandizement of other nations.</p>

<p class="center"><big>ON PAPER MONEY.</big></p>
<p class="center"><small>[Published at <i>Baltimore</i>, August 9, 1785.]</small></p>

<p class="indent">Messrs. <span class="smcap">Printers</span>,</p>

<p>I observed a paragraph of intelligence in your
Journal, of the 26th of July, respecting the circulation
of paper currency in North Carolina. I am not
disposed to dispute the truth of the fact, that paper currency
passes in that State at par with specie; but I should
be very sorry to see it drawn into a precedent for other
States.</p>

<p><i>The scarcity of cash</i> is a general complaint, and superficial
observers impute the evil to a wrong cause, while
shallow reasoners would remedy it by an emission of
paper credit.</p>

<p>The real state of our commerce is this; since the ratification
of peace, the quantity of goods imported into
the United States has been much greater than what
was necessary for the consumption of the inhabitants.
Perhaps I shall not be wide of the truth, when I suppose
that one third of the importations would supply
the demands of people. The consequence is, the other
two thirds continue on hand as a superfluity. The
merchant finds no market for his goods, and erroneously
imputes the evil to a scarcity of cash. But the
real truth is, people do not want his goods; they purchase
what they want, and find cash or produce to
make payment; but the surplus remains in store.</p>

<p>In every trading nation, there ought to be a due proportion
between the commercial interest, the agricultural
and the manufacturing. Whenever the farmers and
manufacturers are too numerous for the merchants,
produce and manufactures will be plentiful and cheap;
trade will of course be lucrativ. Whenever the merchants
are too numerous for the laborers, the importations of
<span class="pb" id="Pg120">[pg 120]</span>
the former will exceed the wants of the latter; of
course goods will not find vent; and the merchant
who owes nothing may lie and sleep in indolence, while
the merchant who deals on credit <i>must fail</i>. The experience
of almost every day proves the <i>truth of this
reasoning</i>. I will suppose that the number of merchants,
and the quantity of goods in Baltimore, are double to
what they were two years ago; and the market for
goods is nearly the same. The effect will be, that the
same profit of business will be divided among double
the number of men, while, at the same time, rents and
the price of provision in market will be double. The
clear profit of the merchant will therefore be reduced
to one fourth part of what it was two years ago. I
submit to the inhabitants of this <i>flourishing</i> town, whether
this is a mere supposition, or a moderate state of
facts; and whether this reasoning will not, in a greater
or less degree, apply to every commercial town in the
United States.</p>

<p>But is not money scarce? With respect to the quantity
of goods in store, <i>money is very scarce</i>: With respect
to the produce of the country, there is <i>money
enough</i>. Almost every article of home produce will
command cash; but the merchant cannot get cash for
his goods. Money is the representativ of goods bought
and sold. I will suppose, for the sake of argument,
that two years ago there was cash enough in the country
to purchase all the goods in market at the usual advance.
I will suppose that the quantity of goods has
been trebled since that time. In this case, had the
quantity of money continued the same, there would
have been cash enough to purchase just one third of the
goods. But suppose what is true, that at the time the
quantity of goods increases in this proportion, the
quantity of money in circulation diminishes in the same
proportion. In this case there will be but one third of
the cash to purchase three times the goods. Thus but
one sixth part of the goods can be purchased by the
circulating cash. The merchant must then lower the
price of his goods to one sixth of their value, or keep
<span class="pb" id="Pg121">[pg 121]</span>
them on hand. This reasoning, however mathematical,
is just, and applies to all commercial countries.
It is a fair state of facts in America. But though the
quantity of money is greatly diminished, yet there is
sufficient to represent the produce of the country, which
in quantity continues the same. The price is however
lowered by the diminution of the quantity of circulating
cash.</p>

<p>Whether the quantity of cash is diminished, and the
quantity of goods increased in the exact proportion above
stated, is not material, the foregoing reasoning
being sufficient to illustrate the principle. The probability
is, that the disproportion between the goods in
market and the cash in circulation, is greater than I
have supposed.</p>

<p>The following propositions, I venture to assert, are
generally, if not universally, true:</p>

<p>1. That the imports of a country should never exceed
its exports. In other words, the value of the
goods imported should never exceed the value of the
superfluous produce, or that part of the produce which
the inhabitants do not want for their own consumption.</p>

<p>2. That too great a quantity of cash in circulation,
is a much greater evil than too small a quantity.</p>

<p>3. That too much money in a commercial country
will inevitably produce a scarcity.</p>

<p>4. That the wealth of a country does not consist in
cash, but in the produce of industry, viz. in agriculture
and manufactures.</p>

<p>5. That in a commercial country, where people are
industrious, there can never be, for any long time, a
want of cash sufficient for a medium.</p>

<p>The first proposition is universally acknowleged to
be true.</p>

<p>The second is less obvious, but equally true. Too
much money raises the price of labor and of its effects;
deprives us consequently of a foreign market;
produces indolence and dissipation; than which greater
evils cannot happen to a State. The sudden increase
<span class="pb" id="Pg122">[pg 122]</span>
of money, by large emissions of paper credit, at
the beginning of the late war, produced more luxury,
indolence, corruption of morals, and other fatal effects,
than all other causes that ever took place in America.
We feel these evils to this moment. On the other
hand, a scarcity of cash, tho it cramps commerce for a
moment, always checks the evils before mentioned, lowers
the price of labor, and produce will of course find a
profitable market; it produces economy and industry,
and consequently preserves the morals of the people;
for industry goes further in preserving purity of morals,
than all the sermons that were ever preached.</p>

<p>This leads to an illustration of the third proposition.
If too much money in a country raises the price of labor
and of produce, the consequence is, that people
will go abroad for articles, because they are cheaper in
foreign markets, and they will purchase as long as they
can get cash. Importations will be multiplied till the
country is drained of cash, and then business will return
to a new channel. The history of trade in America,
the last two years, is an illustration of this proposition.</p>

<p>The fourth proposition, also, is illustrated by facts.
I will suppose that ten millions of dollars are sufficient
for a medium in America: Let that sum be instantaneously
augmented to twenty millions, and the country
is not a farthing richer, for the price of goods will be
immediately doubled. <i>Two</i> dollars, in the latter case,
purchase no more than <i>one</i> in the former. People ignorantly
suppose that goods rise in value; when the
fact is, money falls in value. Continental currency
was a proof of this. There was cash enough for a
medium in the country before the war; and the addition
of two hundred millions of dollars did not increase
the wealth of the country one farthing; nor
would the whole purchase more than the ten millions
of specie which circulated before the war. Had the
paper all been Spanish milled dollars, the effect would
have been the same, had they continued in the country,
and not been hoarded.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg123">[pg 123]</span>
The fifth proposition depends on this simple fact,
that money is a fluid in the commercial world, rolling
from hand to hand wherever it is wanted, and there is
any thing to purchase it. Let the produce of a country
excel, in the least degree, the consumption, and it
will never want money.</p>

<p>Admitting the foregoing observations to be true,
both the necessity and policy of emitting paper,
vanish at once. Supposing paper currency to preserve
its credit, still so far from increasing the medium of
trade, that in a few months it will drive all the specie
from the country. Bank notes and bills of exchange
are useful in facilitating a change or conveyance of
property; but to issue paper credit, merely with a view
to increase the circulating medium, in a country where
the people may have just as much gold and silver as
they are pleased to work for, is the height of folly. If
people are indolent, or extravagant, all the paper currency
under heaven will not make them rich, or supply
their wants of cash. If people are industrious and
frugal, and purchase no more foreign goods than they
can pay for in superfluous produce, they will ever have
cash enough. Their whole system of commerce stands
on these single facts.</p>

<p>If the merchants bring more goods than people
want, business <i>must be dull</i>; money with them <i>must be
scarce</i>. At the close of the war, cash was plentiful and
goods scarce. This made business lively, till people
had procured a supply. Remittances were made in
cash, so long as it could be obtained. That period is
past, and the merchant must now look for remittances
where alone they ought ever to be found, in the produce
of the country. Business is just now returning into
its proper channel, from which it had been diverted by
the violence of war, and the fluctuations of paper credit.
The rapid population of a country is an agreeable
circumstance; but every profession ought to increase in
a due proportion. Supposing ten thousand carpenters
were to land in Baltimore at once, would they have
business? Or would they not exclaim, <i>business is dull</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Pg124">[pg 124]</span>
<i>money is scarce</i>? Every one might have a trifle of business,
but they could not <i>all make fortunes</i>.</p>

<p>An event similar to this has taken place in Baltimore.
The reputation for business which Baltimore
had acquired just at the close of the war, brought merchants
here from every part of the world, and almost
one half of the town has been built within two years.
How, in the name of common sense, do the merchants
expect to find business? The people who come to
this market, multiply gradually, and double in about
thirty years. But the merchants who supply the goods
have doubled, if not trebled, in numbers and stock,
within three years. There is, however, an expedient
which will yet enable them all to liv by trade. Let
every merchant send abroad to Ireland or Germany,
and bring over his hundred able industrious farmers,
and fix them on the fertile lands of Maryland, which
now lie useless and uncultivated in the hands of the
Nabobs: Or let three fourths of the traders quit the
business. Either of these expedients will make cash
plentiful; and one of them must take place.</p>

<p>I will just make one further remark; the want of a
proper <i>union</i> among the States, will always render our
commerce fluctuating and unprofitable. We may do
as much business as we please; but if the duties and
restrictions on our trade remain, and the flag of the
United States is insulted as it has been, and each State
is laying duties on the trade of its neighbor, our commerce
cannot be reduced to a system, and our profits
must be uncertain. The want of a <i>Continental Power</i>
to guard the honor of the whole body, and reduce our
measures to one uniform system, is the great source of
endless calamities. We shall feel national abuse, till
Congress are vested with powers sufficient to <i>govern</i>
and <i>protect</i> us; and till that period, foreigners, like so
many harpies, will prey upon our commerce, and disappoint
the exertions of our industry.</p>

<p class="center"><big><i>On</i> REDRESS <i>of</i> GRIEVANCES.</big></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span class="ralign"><small>NEWBURY PORT, 1786.</small></span></p>

<p>By some resolves of the discontented people of this
State, (Massachusetts) it appears that the true
cause of public grievances is mistaken, and consequently
the mode of redress will be mistaken. It is laughable
enough to hear the people gravely resolving, that
the sitting of the general court at Boston is a grievance,
when every body may recollect that about twelve years
ago, the removal of the Legislature to Cambridge, was
a grievance; an unconstitutional stretch of power, that
threw the province into a bustle. A great change,
since Hutchinson's time! Boston then was the only
proper seat of the Legislature.</p>

<p>Lawyers, too, are squeezed into the catalogue of
grievances. Why, sir, lawyers are a consequence; not
a cause of public evils. They grow out of the laziness,
dilatoriness in payment of debts, breaches of contract,
and other vices of the people; just as mushrooms
grow out of dunghills after a shower, or as distilleries
spring out of the <i>taste</i> for New England rum. The
sober, industrious, frugal Dutch, in New York, and the
Quakers and Germans in Pensylvania, have no occasion
for lawyers; a collector never calls upon them
twice, and they feel no grievances. Before the war,
there was, in Orange county, New York, but one action
of debt tried in eighteen years. O happy people!
happy times! no grievances.</p>

<p>Mr. Printer, I saw a man the other day, <ins class="corr" title="crying" id="C125">carrying</ins> a
bushel or two of flaxseed. Flaxseed is a cash article,
and cash pays taxes. The man wanted cash to pay his
taxes; he <i>must</i> have cash; but, Mr. Printer, half an
hour afterwards, I saw him half drunk, and his saddle
bags filled with coffee. But, sir, coffee pays no taxes.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg126">[pg 126]</span>
Another, a few days ago, brought a lamb to market.
Lambs command cash, and cash pays taxes; but the
good countryman went to a store, and bought a feather;
five shillings for a feather, Mr. Printer, and feathers
pay no taxes. Is it not a <i>grievance</i>, sir, that feathers
and ribbands, and coffee and new rum, will not pay
taxes?</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Printer, in my humble opinion, there are
but two effectual methods of redressing grievances;
one depends on the people as individuals, and the other
on the Supreme Executiv authority.</p>

<p>As to the first, let every person, whether farmer, mechanic,
lawyer, or doctor, provide a small box, (<i>a small
box</i> will be big enough) with a hole in the lid. When
he receives a shilling, let him put six pence into the box,
and use the other six pence in providing for his family;
not rum or feathers, but good bread and meat. Let
this box remain untouched, until the collector shall
call. Then let it be opened, the tax paid, and the
overplus of cash may be expended on gauze, ribbands,
tea, and New England rum. Let the box then be put
into its place again, to receive pence for the next collector.
This method, Mr. Printer, will redress all
grievances, without the trouble, noise and expense of
town meetings, conventions and mobs.</p>

<p>As to the other method, sir, I can only say, were I
at the head of the Executiv authority, I should soon
put the question to a decisiv issue. It should be determined,
on the first insurrection, whether our lives
and our properties shall be secure under the law and
the constitution of the State, or whether they must depend
on the mad resolves of illegal meetings. Honest
men then would know whether they may rest in safety
at home, or whether they must seek for tranquillity in
some distant country.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="ralign"><small>PROVIDENCE, 1786.</small></span></p>

<p>That the political body, like the animal, is liable
to violent diseases, which, for a time, baffle the
healing art, is a truth which we all acknowlege, and
which most of us lament. But as most of the disorders,
incident to the human frame, are the consequence
of an intemperate indulgence of its appetites, or of
neglecting the most obvious means of safety; so most
of the popular tumults, which disturb government, arise
from an abuse of its blessings, or an inattention to
its principles. A man of a robust constitution, relying
on its strength, riots in gratifications which weaken the
<i>stamina vitÃ¦</i>; the surfeiting pleasures of a few years
destroy the power of enjoyment; and the full fed voloptuary
feels a rapid transition to the meagre valetudinarian.
Thus people who enjoy an uncommon
share of political privileges, often carry their freedom
to licentiousness, and put it out of their power to enjoy
society by destroying its support.</p>

<p><i>Too much health</i> is a <i>disease</i>, which often requires a
very strict regimen; <i>too much liberty</i> is the worst of <i>tyranny</i>;
and <i>wealth</i> may be accumulated to such a degree
as to <i>impoverish</i> a State. If <i>all</i> men attempt to become
<i>masters</i>, the <i>most</i> of them would necessarily become
<i>slaves</i> in the attempt; and could <i>every man</i> on earth
possess millions of joes, <i>every man</i> would be <i>poorer</i> than
<i>any man</i> is now, and infinitely more wretched, because
they could not procure the necessaries of life.</p>

<p>My countrymen, it is a common saying now, that
<i>the devil is in you</i>. I question the influence of the
devil, however, in these affairs. Divines and politicians
agree in this, to father all evil upon the devil;
<span class="pb" id="Pg128">[pg 128]</span>
but the effects ascribed to this prince of evil spirits, both
in the moral and political world, I ascribe to the wickedness
and ignorance of the human heart. Taking
the word <i>Devil</i> in this sense, he is <i>in</i> you, and <i>among</i>
you, in a variety of shapes.</p>

<p>In the first place, the <i>weakness of our federal government
is the devil</i>. It prevents the adoption of any measures
that are requisit for us, as a nation; it keeps us from
paying our honest debts; it also throws out of our power
all the profits of commerce, and this drains us of
cash. Is not this the devil? Yes, my countrymen,
an empty purse is the <i>devil</i>.</p>

<p>You say you are jealous of your rights, and dare not
trust Congress. Well, that jealousy is an evil spirit,
and all evil spirits are <i>devils</i>. So far the devil is in you.
You act, in this particular, just like the crew of a ship,
who would not trust the helm with <i>one</i> of their number,
because he might <i>possibly</i> run her ashore, when by
leaving her without a pilot, they were <i>certain</i> of shipwreck.
You act just like men, who in raising a building,
would not have a master workman, because he
<i>might</i> give out wrong orders. You will be masters
yourselves; and as you are not all ready to lift at the
same time, one labors at a stick of timber, then another,
then a third; you are then vexed that it is not
raised; why let a master order thirteen of you to take
hold together, and you will lift it at once. Every family
has a <i>master</i> (or a <i>mistress</i>&mdash;I beg the ladies' pardon.)
When a ship or a house is to be built, there is a master;
when highways are repairing, there is a master;
every little school has a master; the continent is a great
school; the boys are numerous, and full of roguish
tricks, and there is no <i>master</i>. The boys in this great
school play truant, and there is no person to chastise
them. Do you think, my countrymen, that America
is more easily governed than a school? You do very
well in small matters; extend your reason to great
ones. Would you not laugh at a farmer who would
fasten a cable to a plough, and yet attempt to draw a
house with a cobweb? "And Nathan said unto David,
<span class="pb" id="Pg129">[pg 129]</span>
<i>thou art the man</i>." You think a master necessary to
govern a <i>few</i> harmless children in a school or family;
yet leave thousands of great rogues to be governed by
<i>good advice</i>. Believe me, my friends, for I am <i>serious</i>;
you <i>lose rights</i>, because you will not giv your magistrates
authority to <i>protect them</i>. Your liberty is despotism,
because it has no control; your power is nothing,
because it is not united.</p>

<p>But further, luxury rages among you, and luxury is
<i>the devil</i>. The war has sent this evil demon to impoverish
people, and embarrass the public. The articles
of rum and tea alone, which are drank in this country,
would pay all its taxes. But when we add, sugar, coffee,
feathers, and the whole list of baubles and trinkets,
what an enormous expense? No wonder you want
paper currency. My countrymen are all grown very
tasty! Feathers and jordans must all be imported!
Certainly gentlemen, the devil is among you. A
Hampshire man, who drinks forty shillings worth of
rum in a year, and never thinks of the expense, will
raise a mob to reduce the governor's salary, which
does not amount to three pence a man per annum. Is
not this the devil?</p>

<p>My countrymen&mdash;A writer appeared, not long ago,
informing you how to redress grievances.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" title="See page 125." class="fnanchor">[40]</a> He
givs excellent advice. Let every man make a little
box, and put into it <i>four pence</i> every day. This in a
year will amount to six pounds one shilling and eight
pence, a sum more than sufficient to pay any poor
man's tax. Any man can pay three or four pence a
day, though no poor man can, at the end of a year,
pay six pounds. Take my advice, every man of you,
and you will hardly feel your taxes.</p>

<p>But further, a <i>tender law</i> is the <i>devil</i>. When I trust
a man a sum of money, I expect he will return the
full value. That Legislature which says my debtor
may pay me with <i>one third</i> of the value he received,
commits a deliberate act of villany; an act for which
an <i>individual</i>, in any government, would be honored
<span class="pb" id="Pg130">[pg 130]</span>
with a whipping post, and in most governments, with
a gallows. When a man makes dollars, one third of
which only is silver, and passes them for good coin, he
must lose his ears, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But Legislatures can, with the solemn face of rulers,
and guardians of justice, boldly give currency to an
<i>adulterated coin</i>, enjoin it upon debtors to cheat their
creditors, and enforce their systematic knavery with legal
penalties. The differences between the man who
makes and passes counterfeit money, and the man who
tenders his creditor one third of the value of the debt,
and demands a discharge, is the same as between a
thief and a robber. The first cheats his neighbor in
the dark, and takes his property without his knowlege:
The last boldly meets him at noon day, tells him he is
a rascal, and demands his purse.</p>

<p>My countrymen, the devil is among you. Make
<i>paper</i> as much as you please; make it a tender in all
<i>future contracts</i>, or let it rest on its own bottom: But
remember that past contracts are <i>sacred things</i>; that
Legislatures have no right to interfere with them; they
have no right to say, a debt shall be paid at a discount,
or in any manner which the parties never intended. It
is the business of justice to fulfil the intention of parties
in contracts, not to defeat them. To pay <i>bona
fide</i> contracts for cash, in paper of little value, or in old
horses, would be a dishonest attempt in an individual;
but for Legislatures to frame laws to support and encourage
such detestable villany, is like a judge who
should inscribe the arms of a rogue over the feat of justice,
or clergymen who should convert into bawdy-houses
the temples of Jehovah. My countrymen, the
world says, the devil is in you: Mankind detest you as
they would a nest of robbers.</p>

<p>But lastly, mobs and conventions are devils. Good
men love law and legal measures. Knaves only fear
law, and try to destroy it. My countrymen, if a constitutional
Legislature cannot redress a grievance, a
mob never can. Laws are the security of life and
property; nay, what is more, of liberty. The man
<span class="pb" id="Pg131">[pg 131]</span>
who encourages a mob to prevent the operation of law,
ceases to be <i>free or safe</i>; for the same principle which
leads a man to put a bayonet to the breast of a judge,
will lead him to take property where he can find
it; and when the judge dare not act, where is the
loser's remedy? Alas, my friends, too much liberty is
no liberty at all. Giv me any thing but mobs; for
mobs are the devil in his worst shape. I would shoot
the leader of a mob, sooner than a midnight ruffian.
People may have grievances, perhaps, and no man
would more readily hold up his hand to redress them
than myself; but mobs rebel against laws of their own,
and rebellion is a crime which admits of no palliation.</p>

<p>My countrymen, I am a private, peaceable man. I
have nothing to win or to lose by the game of paper
currency; but <i>I revere justice</i>. I would sooner pick
oakum all my life, than stain my reputation, or pay my
creditor one farthing less than his honest demands.</p>

<p>While you attempt to trade to advantage, without a
<i>head</i> to combine all the States into systematic, uniform
measures, the world will laugh at you for fools. While
merchants take and giv credit, the world will call
them idiots, and laugh at their ruin. While farmers
get credit, borrow money, and mortgage their farms,
the world will call them fools, and laugh at their embarrassments.
While all men liv beyond their income,
and are harrassed with duns and sheriffs, no man
will pity them, or giv them relief. But when mobs
and conventions oppose the courts of justice, and Legislatures
make paper or old horses a legal tender in all
cases, the world will exclaim with one voice&mdash;<i>Ye are
rogues, and the devil is in you!</i></p>

<p class="center"><big>DESULTORY THOUGHTS.</big></p>

<p>No government has preserved more general and
uninterrupted tranquillity for a long period, than
that of Connecticut. This is a strong proof of the force
of habit, and the danger that ever attends great alterations
of government or a suspension of law. Every
system of civil policy must take its complexion from
the spirit and manners of the people.</p>

<p>Whatever political constitutions may be formed on
paper, or in the philosopher's closet, those only can be
permanent which arise out of the genius of the people.</p>

<p>A jealous uneasy temper has sometimes appeared, among
the people of this State; but as this has always
proceeded from restless, ambitious men, whose designs
have been reprobated as soon as detected, this uneasiness
has always subsided without any violence to the Constitution.
We do not advert to the time when the
course of law has been forcibly obstructed in Connecticut.</p>

<p>In the middle and southern States the corrupt English
mode of elections has been adopted: We see men
meanly stoop to advertise for an office, or beg the votes
of their countrymen. In those States elections are
often mere riots; almost always attended with disputes
and bloody noses, and sometimes with greater violence.
In Connecticut, a man never advertises for an office,
nor do we know that a man ever solicited a vote for
himself. We cannot name the election that produced
a dispute, even in words.</p>

<p>It belongs to the unprincipled of other States and
countries to deride religion and its preachers. It belongs
to the coxcombs of courts, the productions of
dancing schools and playhouses, to ridicule our bashful
<span class="pb" id="Pg133">[pg 133]</span>
deportment and simplicity of manners. We revere
the ancient institutions of schools and churches in this
State. We revere the discipline which has given such
a mild complexion to the manners of its inhabitants,
and secured private satisfaction and public tranquillity.</p>

<p><i>Paper money</i> is the present hobby horse of the States,
and every State has more or less of the <i>paper madness</i>.
What a pity it is mankind will not discern their right
hands from their left. <i>Cash is scarce</i>, is the general
cry. Well, this proves nothing more than that the
balance of trade is against us, and that we eat, drink,
and wear more foreign commodities than we can pay
for in produce: That is, we spend more than we
earn; or in other words, <i>we are poor</i>.</p>

<p>But nothing shows the folly of people more, than
their attempts to remedy the evil by a <i>paper currency</i>.
This is <i>ignorance</i>, it is <i>absurdity</i> in the extreme. Do
not people know that the addition of millions and millions
of money does not increase the value of a circulating
medium one farthing. Do they not know that
the value of a medium ought not to be increased beyond
a certain ratio, even if it could be? and that to
increase the circulating cash of one State beyond the
circulating cash of other States, is a material injury to
it. These propositions are as demonstrable as any
problem in Euclid. Ten millions of dollars in specie
were supposed to be the medium in America before
the war. Congress issued at first five millions in bills.
As these came <i>into</i> circulation, specie went <i>out</i>; consequently
they held their nominal and real value on par,
for the nominal value of the medium was not much
increased. Congress sent out another sum in bills;
the nominal value of the medium was doubled, the
bills sunk one half, and the real value of the medium
remained the same. This was the subsequent progress;
every emission sunk the real value of bills, and
two hundred millions of dollars were, in the end, worth
just ten millions in specie, and no more. Towards
the close of the war, the specie in America was more
than doubled; it sunk to less than half its former value,
<span class="pb" id="Pg134">[pg 134]</span>
and the paper bills sunk in the same proportion;
from forty to eighty for one, nearly. We had too
much specie in the country, in the years 1782 and
1783; it ruined hundreds of merchants, and injured
the community.</p>

<p>But it is said, we want a circulating medium. This
is not true; we have too much in circulation. The
specie and paper now circulating in America, amounts
to fifty or sixty millions of dollars; whereas we want
not more than ten or fifteen millions. The paper is
therefore sunk in real value, so as to reduce the real
value of the whole medium to that sum which is wanted.
We may make millions of paper if we please;
but we shall not add one farthing to the property of the
State. Money is not wealth in a State, but the representativ
of wealth. A paper currency may answer a
temporary purpose of enabling people to pay debts;
but it is not an advantage even to the debtor, unless it
is depreciated; and in this case it is an injury to the
creditor. If the paper retains its value, the debtor
must sooner or later purchase it with the produce of
his labor; and if it depreciates, it is the tool of knaves
while it circulates; it ruins thousands of honest unsuspecting
people; it gives the game to the idle speculator,
who is a nuisance to the State; it stabs public
credit and private confidence; and what is worse than
all, it unhinges the obligations which unite mankind.
A fluctuation of medium in a State makes more fatal
ravages among the morals of people, than a pestilence
among their lives. O America! happy would it have
been for thy peace, thy morals, thy industry, if, instead
of a depreciation of paper bills and securities, stamped
with public faith, millions of infernal spirits had been
let loose among thy inhabitants! Never, never wilt
thou experience the return of industry, economy, private
confidence and public content, till every species of
depreciated and fluctuating medium shall be annihilated;
till Legislatures learn to revere justice, and dread a
breach of faith more than the vengeance of vindictiv
heaven!</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg135">[pg 135]</span>
Americans! you talk of a scarcity of cash. Well,
the only remedy is, to enable Congress to place our
commerce on a footing with the trade of other nations.
Foreign States have nothing to do with Massachusetts
or New York. They must make treaties
with <i>United America</i>, or not make them at all. And
while we boast of the independence of particular States,
we lose all the benefits of independence. For fear
that Congress would abuse their powers and enrich
themselves, we, like the dog in the manger, will not
even enrich ourselves. We complain of poverty, and
yet <i>giv</i> the profits of our trade to foreign nations.
Infatuated men! We have one truth to learn&mdash;<i>That
nothing but the absolute power of regulating our commerce,
vested in some federal head</i>, can ever restore to us cash, or
turn the balance of trade in our favor. New York
alone, by its advantageous situation, is growing rich
upon the spoils of her neighbors, and impoverishing
the continent to fill her own treasury.</p>

<p>Lawyers, you say, O deluded Americans! are an
evil. Will you always be fools? Why lawyers are as
good men as others: I venture to say further, that
lawyers in this country have devised and brought about
the wisest public measures that any State has adopted.
My countrymen, the expense of supporting a hundred
lawyers is a very great and a very needless expense.
You pay to lawyers and courts every year thirty or
forty thousand pounds. A great expense, indeed!
But courts and lawyers are not to be blamed. The
people are the cause of the evil, and they alone, as individuals,
are able to remedy it. And yet the remedy
is very simple. <i>Cease to run in debt</i>, or <i>pay your debts
punctually</i>; then lawyers will cease to exist, and court
houses will be shut. If you wish or expect any other
remedy than this, you certainly will be disappointed.
A man, who purposely rushes down a precipice and
breaks his arm, has no right to say, that surgeons are
an evil in society. A Legislature may unjustly limit
the surgeon's fee; but the broken arm must be healed,
and a surgeon is the only man to do it.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg136">[pg 136]</span>
My friends, learn wisdom. You are peaceable yet,
and let the distractions of your neighbors teach you to
preserve your tranquillity.</p>

<p>Spend less money than you earn, and you will every
day grow richer. Never run in debt, and lawyers will
become farmers. Never make paper money, and you
will not cheat your citizens, nor have it to redeem.
Above all, pay your public debts, for independence and
the confederation require it.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">my friends,</span></p>

<p>Times are hard; money is scarce; taxes are
high, and private debts push us. What shall
we do? Why, hear a few facts, stubborn facts, and
then take a bit of advice.</p>

<p>In the year 1637, our good forefathers declared an
offensiv war against the Pequot Indians. Their troops
were ninety men. Weathersfield was ordered to furnish
a hog for this army, Windsor a ram goat, and Hartford
a hogshead of beer, and four or five gallons of
strong water.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" title="See the records of this State, where rum is called strong water. This was soon after the first distilling of spirits, and rum was not then named. It seems, however, that our pious ancestors had a taste for it, which their posterity have carefully improved." class="fnanchor">[41]</a> </p>

<p>This was ancient simplicity! Let us make a little
estimation of the expenses annually incurred in Connecticut.
(I say incurred, for we can contract debts,
though we cannot pay them.)</p>

<p>I will just make a distinction between necessary and
unnecessary expenses.</p>

<p>Now, good people, I have a word of advice for you.
I will tell you how to pay your taxes and debts, without
feeling them.</p>

<p>1st. Fee no lawyers.</p>

<p>You say lawyers have too high fees. I say they
have not. They cost me not one farthing. Do as I
have always done, and lawyers' fees will be no trouble
at all. If I want a new coat, or my wife wants a new
gown, we have agreed to wear the old ones until we
have got cash or produce to pay for them. When we
buy, we pay in hand; we get things cheaper than our
neighbors; merchants never dun us, and we have no
lawyers' fees to pay. When we see sheriffs and duns
<span class="pb" id="Pg140">[pg 140]</span>
knocking at the doors of our neighbors, we laugh at
their folly. Besides, I keep a little drawer in my desk,
with money enough in it to pay the next tax; and I
never touch a farthing until the collector calls. Now,
good folks, if you will take the same method, you will
save out of lawyers' fees and court charges, on the most
moderate calculations, 20,000l. a year.</p>

<p>2dly. I allow my family but two gallons of rum a
year. This is enough for any family, and too much
for most of them. I drink cyder and beer of my own
manufacture; and my wife makes excellent beer, I assure
you. I advise you all to do the same. I am astonished
at you, good folks. Not a mechanic or a
laborer goes to work for a merchant, but he carries
home a bottle of rum. Not a load of wood comes to
town, but a gallon bottle is tied to the cart stake to be
filled with rum. Scarcely a woman comes to town
with tow cloth, but she has a wooden gallon bottle in
one side of her saddle bags, to fill with rum. A stranger
would think you to be a nation of Indians by
your thirst for this paltry liquor. Take a bit of advice
from a good friend of yours. Get two gallons
of rum in a year; have two or three frolics of innocent
mirth; keep a little spirit for a medicine, and let your
common drink be the produce or manufacture of this
country. This will make a saving of almost 400,000
gallons of rum, or 80,000l. a year.</p>

<p>3dly. Never buy any useless clothing.</p>

<p>Keep a good suit for Sundays and other public days;
but let your common wearing apparel be good substantial
cloths, and linens of your own manufacture. Let
your wives and daughters lay aside their plumes.
Feathers and fripperies suit the Cherokees or the
wench in your kitchen; but they little become the fair
daughters of America.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" title="I would just mention to my fair readers, whom I love and esteem, that feathers and other frippery of the head, are disreputable in Europe." class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Out of the dry goods imported,
you may save 50,000l. a year.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg141">[pg 141]</span>
These savings amount to 150,000l. a year. This is
more than enough to pay the interest of all our public
debts.</p>

<p>My countrymen, I am not trifling with you: I am
serious. You feel the facts I state; you know you are
poor, and ought to know, the fault is all your own.
Are you not satisfied with the food and drink which
this country affords? The beef, the pork, the wheat,
the corn, the butter, the cheese, the cyder, the beer,
those luxuries which are heaped in profusion upon your
tables? If not, you must expect to be poor. In vain
do you wish for mines of gold and silver. A mine
would be the greatest curse that could befal this country.
There is gold and silver enough in the world, and
if you have not enough of it, it is because you consume
all you earn in useless food and drink. In vain do you
wish to increase the quantity of cash by a mint, or by
paper emissions. Should it rain millions of joes into
your chimnies, on your present system of expenses, you
would still have no money. It would leave the country
in streams. Trifle not with serious subjects, nor
spend your breath in empty wishes. Reform; economize.
This is the whole of your political duty.
You may reason, speculate, complain, raise mobs,
spend life in railing at Congress and your rulers; but
unless you import less than you export, unless you spend
less than you earn, you will eternally be poor.</p>

<h2><span class="pb" id="Pg142">[pg 142]</span>No. XIII.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<span class="ralign"><small>NEW YORK, DECEMBER, 1787.</small></span></p>
<p class="center"><big><i>To the</i> DISSENTING MEMBERS <i>of
the late</i> <span class="smcap">Convention</span> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">Pennsylvania</span>.</big></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">gentlemen,</span></p>

<p>Your long and elaborate publication, assigning
the reasons for your refusing to subscribe the ratification
of the <i>new Federal Constitution</i>, has made its
appearance in the public papers, and, I flatter myself,
will be read throughout the United States. It will
feed the flame of opposition among the weak, the wicked,
the designing, and the factious; but it will make
many new converts to the proposed government, and
furnish the old friends of it with new weapons of defence.
The very attempt to excite uneasiness and
disturbance in a State, about a measure legally and constitutionally
adopted, after a long and ample discussion
in a convention of the people's delegates, will create
suspicions of the goodness of your cause. My address
to you will not be so lengthy as your publication;
your arguments are <i>few</i>, altho your harangue is <i>long</i>
and <i>insidious</i>.</p>

<p>You begin with telling the world, that <i>no defect was
discovered in the present confederation, till after the war</i>.
Why did you not publish the truth? You know, gentlemen,
that during six years of the war, we had <i>no
confederation at all</i>. You know that the war commenced
in April, 1775, and that we had <i>no confederation</i>
till March, 1781. You know (for some of you
are men of abilities and reading) or ought to know, a
principle of <i>fear</i>, in time of war, operates more powerfully
in binding together the States which have a common
interest, than all the parchment compacts on
earth. Could we, then, discover the defects of our
<span class="pb" id="Pg143">[pg 143]</span>
present confederation, with <i>two years'</i> experience only,
and an enemy in our country? You know we could
not.</p>

<p>I will not undertake to detect the falsehood of every
assertion, or the fallacy of all your reasoning on each
article. In the most of them the public will anticipate
any thing I could say, and confute your arguments as
fast as they read them. But, gentlemen, your reasoning
against the <i>new Constitution</i> resembles that of Mr.
Hume on miracles. You begin with some <i>gratis dicta</i>,
which are denied; you assume <i>premises</i> which are <i>totally
false</i>, and then reason on them with great address.
Your whole reasoning, and that of all the opposers of
the federal government, is built on this <i>false principle</i>,
that the <i>federal Legislature</i> will be a body <i>distinct from</i>
and <i>independent of</i> the people. Unless your opposition
is grounded on <i>that principle</i>, it stands on <i>nothing</i>; and
on any <i>other</i> supposition, your arguments are but <i>declamatory
nonsense</i>.</p>

<p>But the principle is false. The Congress, under
the proposed constitution, will have the <i>same interest</i> as
the people; they are <i>a part</i> of the people; their interest
is <i>inseparable</i> from that of the people; and this union
of interest will eternally remain, while the right of election
shall continue in the people. Over this right
Congress will have no control: The time and manner
of exercising that right are very wisely vested in Congress;
otherwise a delinquent State might embarrass
the measures of the Union. The safety of the public
requires that the federal body should prevent any particular
delinquency; but the <i>right of election</i> is above
their control; it <i>must</i> remain in the people, and be exercised
once in two, four or six years. A body thus
organized, with thirteen Legislatures watching their
measures, and several millions of jealous eyes inspecting
their conduct, would not be apt to betray their
constituents. Yet this is not the best ground of safety.
The first and almost only principle that governs
men, is <i>interest</i>. <i>Love of our country</i> is a powerful auxiliary
motiv to patriotic actions; but rarely or never
<span class="pb" id="Pg144">[pg 144]</span>
operates against <i>private interest</i>. The only requisit to
secure liberty, is to connect the <i>interest</i> of the <i>governors</i>
with that of the <i>governed</i>. Blend these interests; make
them inseparable, and both are safe from voluntary invasion.
How shall this union be formed? This question
is answered. The union is formed by the equal
principles on which the people of these States hold
their property and their rights. But how shall this
union of interests be perpetuated? The answer is easy;
bar all perpetuities of estates; prevent any exclusiv
rights; preserve all preferment dependent on the choice
of the people; suffer no power to exist independent of
the people or their representativs. While there exists
no power in a State, which is independent <ins class="corr" title="on" id="C144">of</ins> the will
of the electors, the rights of the people are secure.
The only barrier against tyranny, that is necessary in
any State, is <i>the election of legislators</i> by the yeomanry of
that State. Preserve <i>that</i>, and every privilege is safe.
The legislators thus chosen to represent the people,
should have all the power that the people would have,
were they assembled in one body to deliberate upon
public measures. The distinction between the powers
of the <i>people</i> and of their <i>representativs</i> in the Legislature,
is as absurd in <i>theory</i>, as it proves pernicious in
<i>practice</i>. A distinction, which has already countenanced
and supported <i>one rebellion</i> in America; has
prevented many <i>good</i> measures; has produced many
<i>bad</i>; has created animosities in many States, and embarrassments
in all.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" title="Some of the bills of rights in America declare, that the people have a right to meet together, and consult for the public safety; that their legislators are responsible to them; that they are servants, &amp;c. Such declarations give people an idea, that as individuals, or in town meetings, they have a power paramount to that of the Legislature. No wonder, that with such ideas, they attempt to resist law." class="fnanchor">[43]</a> It has taught the people a lesson,
which, if they continue to practise, will bring laws
into contempt, and frequently mark our country with
blood.</p>

<p>You object, gentlemen, to the powers vested in Congress.
Permit me, to ask you, where will you limit
<span class="pb" id="Pg145">[pg 145]</span>
their powers? What bounds will you prescribe? You
will reply&mdash;<i>we will reserve certain rights, which we deem
invaluable, and restrain our rulers from abridging them</i>.
But, gentlemen, let me ask you, how will you define
these rights? would you say, <i>the liberty of the press shall
not be restrained</i>? Well, what is this liberty of the
press? Is it an unlimited licence to publish <i>any thing
and every thing</i> with impunity? If so, the author and
printer of any treatise, however obscene and blasphemous,
will be screened from punishment. You know,
gentlemen, that there are books extant, so shockingly
and infamously obscene and so daringly blasphemous,
that no society on earth would be vindicable in suffering
the publishers to pass unpunished. You certainly
know that such cases <i>have</i> happened, and <i>may</i> happen
again: Nay, you know that they are <i>probable</i>. Would
not that indefinite expression, <i>the liberty of the press</i>, extend
to the justification of every <i>possible publication</i>?
Yes, gentlemen, you know, that under such a general
license, a man who should publish a treatise to <i>prove
his Maker a knave</i>, must be screened from legal punishment.
I shudder at the thought! But the truth must
not be concealed. The constitutions of several States
<i>guarantee that very license</i>.</p>

<p>But if you attempt to define the <i>liberty of the press</i>,
and ascertain what cases shall fall within that privilege,
during the course of centuries, where will you <i>begin</i>?
Or rather, where will you <i>end</i>? Here, gentlemen, you
will be puzzled. Some publications certainly <i>may</i> be
a breach of civil law: You will not have the effrontery
to deny a truth so obvious and intuitivly evident.
Admit that principle; and unless you can define precisely
the cases, which are, and are not a breach of law,
you have no right to say, the liberty of the press shall
not be restrained; for such a license would warrant
<i>any breach of law</i>. Rather than hazard such an abuse
of privilege, is it not better to leave the right altogether
with your rulers and your posterity? No attempts
have ever been made by a legislativ body in America,
to abridge that privilege; and in this free enlightened
<span class="pb" id="Pg146">[pg 146]</span>
country, no attempts could succeed, unless the public
should be convinced that an abuse of it would warrant
the restriction. Should this ever be the case, you have
no right to say, that a future Legislature, or that posterity
shall not abridge the privilege, or punish its abuses.</p>

<p>But you say, that trial by jury is an unalienable
right, that ought not to be trusted with our rulers.
Why not? If it is such a darling privilege, will not
Congress be as fond of it, as their constituents? An
elevation into that council, does not render a man insensible
to his privileges, nor place him beyond the necessity
of securing them. A member of Congress is
liable to all the operations of law, except during his
attendance on public business; and should he consent
to a law, annihilating any right whatever, he deprives
himself, his family and estate, of the benefit resulting
from that right, as well as his constituents. This circumstance
alone, is a sufficient security.</p>

<p>But, why this outcry about juries? If the people
esteem them so highly, why do they ever neglect them,
and suffer the trial by them to go into disuse? In some
States, <i>Courts of Admiralty</i> have no juries, nor Courts of
Chancery at all. In the City Courts of some States,
juries are rarely or never called, altho the parties may
demand them; and one State, at least, has lately passed
an act, empowering the parties to submit both <i>law</i>
and <i>fact</i> to the court. It is found, that the judgment
of a court gives as much satisfaction, as the verdict of
a jury; for the court are as good judges of fact, as juries,
and much better judges of law. I have no desire to
abolish trials by jury, altho the original design and excellence
of them, is in many cases superseded. While
the people remain attached to this mode of deciding
causes, I am confident, that no Congress can wrest the
privilege from them.</p>

<p>But, gentlemen, our legal proceedings want a reform.
Involved in all the mazes of perplexity, which
the chicanery of lawyers could invent, in the course of
five <ins class="err" title="thousand" id="E146">hundred</ins> years, our road to justice and redressis
<span class="pb" id="Pg147">[pg 147]</span>
tedious, fatiguing and expensiv. Our judicial proceedings
are capable of being simplified, and improved
in almost every particular. For mercy's sake, gentlemen,
do not shut the door against improvement. If
the people of America, should ever spurn the shackles
of opinion, and venture to leave the road, which is so
overgrown with briers and thorns, as to strip a man's
clothes from his back as he passes, I am certain they
can devise a more easy, safe, and expeditious mode of
administering the laws, than that which harasses every
poor mortal, that is wretched enough to want <i>legal</i>
justice. In States where very respectable merchants,
have repeatedly told me, they had rather lose a debt of
fifty pounds, than attempt to recover it by a legal
process, one would think that men, who value liberty
and property, would not restrain any government from
suggesting a remedy for such disorders.</p>

<p>Another right, which you would place beyond the
reach of Congress, is the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. Will
you say that this right may not be suspended in <i>any</i>
case? You dare not. If it may be suspended in any
case, and the Congress are to judge of the necessity,
what security have you in a declaration in its favor?
You had much better say nothing upon the subject.</p>

<p>But you are frightened at a standing army. I beg
you, gentlemen, to define a <i>standing army</i>. If you
would refuse to giv Congress power to raise troops, to
guard our frontiers, and garrison forts, or in short, to
enlist men for any purpose, then we understand you;
you tie the hands of your rulers, so that they cannot
defend you against any invasion. This is protection,
indeed! But if Congress can raise a body of troops for
a year, they can raise them for a <i>hundred years</i>, and
your declaration against <i>standing armies</i> can have no
other effect, than to prevent Congress from denominating
their troops, a <i>standing army</i>. You would only
introduce into this country the English farce of mechanically
passing an annual bill for the support of
troops which are never disbanded.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg148">[pg 148]</span>
You object to the indefinite power of taxation in
Congress. You must then limit the exercise of that
power by the sums of money to be raised; or leaving
the sums indefinite, must prescribe the <i>particular mode</i>
in which, and the <i>articles</i> on which the money is to
be raised. But the sums cannot be ascertained, because
the necessities of the States cannot be foreseen
nor defined. It is beyond even <i>your</i> wisdom and profound
knowlege, gentlemen, to ascertain the public
exigencies, and reduce them to the provisions of a constitution.
And if you would prescribe the mode of
raising money, you will meet with equal difficulty.
The different States have different modes of taxation,
and I question much whether even <i>your</i> skill, gentlemen,
could invent a uniform system that would fit easy
upon every State. It must therefore be left to experiment,
with a power that can correct the errors of a system,
and suit it to the habits of the people. And if
no uniform mode will answer this purpose, it will be
in the power of Congress to lay taxes in each State,
according to its particular practice.</p>

<p>You know that requisitions on the States are ineffectual;
that they cannot be rendered effectual, but by
a compulsory power in Congress; that without an efficient
power to raise money, government cannot secure
person, property or justice; that such power is as safely
lodged in your <i>Representativs</i> in Congress, as it is in
your <i>Representativs</i> in your distinct Legislatures.</p>

<p>You would likewise restrain Congress from requiring
<i>excessiv bail</i> or imposing <i>excessiv fines</i> and <i>unusual punishment</i>.
But unless you can, in every possible instance,
previously define the words <i>excessiv</i> and <i>unusual</i>; if you
leave the discretion of Congress to define them on occasion,
any restriction of their power by a general indefinit
expression, is a nullity&mdash;mere <i>formal nonsense</i>.
What consummate arrogance must you possess, to presume
you can <i>now</i> make <i>better</i> provision for the government
of these States, during the course of ages and
centuries, than the future Legislatures can, on the
spur of the occasion! Yet your whole reasoning on the
<span class="pb" id="Pg149">[pg 149]</span>
subject implies this arrogance, and a presumption that
you have a right to legislate for posterity!</p>

<p>But to complete the list of unalienable rights, you
would insert a clause in your declaration, <i>that every
body shall, in good weather, hunt on his own land, and catch
fish in rivers that are public property</i>. Here, gentlemen,
you must have exerted the whole force of your genius!
Not even the <i>all important</i> subject of <i>legislating for a
world</i>, can restrain my laughter at this clause! As a
supplement to that article of your bill of rights, I
would suggest the following restriction:&mdash;"That Congress
shall never restrain any inhabitant of America
from eating and drinking, <i>at seasonable times</i>, or prevent
his lying on his <i>left side</i>, in a long winter's night, or
even on his back, when he is fatigued by lying on his
<i>right</i>." This article is of just as much consequence as
the eighth clause of your proposed bill of rights.</p>

<p>But to be more serious, gentlemen, you must have
had in idea the forest laws in Europe, when you inserted
that article; for no circumstance that ever took
place in America, could have suggested the thought of
a declaration in favor of hunting and fishing. Will
you forever persist in error? Do you not reflect that
the state of property in America, is directly the reverse
of what it is in Europe? Do you not consider, that
the forest laws in Europe originated in <i>feudal tyranny</i>,
of which not a trace is to be found in America? Do
you not know that in this country almost every farmer
is lord of his own soil? That instead of suffering under
the oppression of a monarch and nobles, a class of
haughty masters, totally independent of the people, almost
every man in America is a <i>lord himself</i>, enjoying
his property in fee? Where then the necessity of laws
to secure hunting and fishing? You may just as well
ask for a clause, giving license for every man to till <i>his
own land</i>, or milk <i>his own cows</i>. The barons in Europe
procured forest laws to secure the right of hunting
on <i>their own land</i>, from the intrusion of those who had
no property in lands. But the distribution of land in
America, not only supersedes the necessity of any laws
<span class="pb" id="Pg150">[pg 150]</span>
upon this subject, but renders them absolutely trifling.
The same laws which secure the property in land, secure
to the owner the right of using it as he pleases.</p>

<p>But you are frightened at the prospect of a <i>consolidation
of the States</i>. I differ from you very widely. I am
afraid, after all our attempts to unite the States, that
contending interests, and the pride of State sovereignties,
will either prevent our union, or render our federal
government weak, slow and inefficient. The danger
is all on this side. If any thing under heaven now endangers
our liberties and independence, it is that single
circumstance.</p>

<p>You harp upon that clause of the new constitution,
which declares, that the laws of the United States, &amp;c.
shall be the supreme law of the land; when you know
that the powers of the Congress are defined, to extend
only to those matters which are in their nature and effects,
<i>general</i>. You know, the Congress cannot meddle
with the internal police of any State, or abridge its
sovereignty. And you know, at the same time, that in
all general concerns, the laws of Congress must be <i>supreme</i>,
or they must be <i>nothing</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><big><i>On</i> TEST LAWS, OATHS <i>of</i> ALLEGIANCE
<i>and</i> ABJURATION, <i>and</i> PARTIAL
EXCLUSIONS <i>from</i> OFFICE.</big></p>

<p>To change the current of opinion, is a most difficult
task, and the attempt is often ridiculed. For
this reason, I expect the following remarks will be
passed over with a slight reading, and all attention to
them cease with a hum.</p>

<p>The revisal of the test law has at length passed by a
respectable majority of the Representativs of this State.
This is a prelude to wiser measures; people are just awaking
from delusion. The time will come (and may
the day be near!) when all test laws, oaths of allegiance,
abjuration, and partial exclusions from civil offices,
will be proscribed from this land of freedom.</p>

<p>Americans! what was the origin of these discriminations?
What is their use?</p>

<p>They originated in savage ignorance, and they are
the instruments of slavery. Emperors and generals,
who wished to attach their subjects to their persons and
government; who wished to exercise despotic sway
over them, or prosecute villanous wars, (for mankind
have always been butchering each other) found the solemnity
of oaths had an excellent effect on poor superstitious
soldiers and vassals; oracles, demons, eclipses;
all the terrifying phenomena of nature, have at times
had remarkable effects in securing the obedience of
men to tyrants. Oaths of fealty, and farcical ceremonies
of homage, were very necessary to rivet the chains
of feudal vassals; for the whole system of European
tenures was erected on <ins class="err" title="jurisdiction" id="E151">usurpation</ins>, and is supported
solely by ignorance, superstition, artifice, or military
<span class="pb" id="Pg152">[pg 152]</span>
force. Oaths of allegiance may possibly be still necessary
in Europe, where there are so many contending
powers contiguous to each other: But what is their
use in America? To secure fidelity to the State, it will
be answered. But where is the danger of defection?
Will the inhabitants join the British in Nova Scotia or
Canada? Will they rebel? Will they join the savages,
and overthrow the State? No; all these are visionary
dangers. My countrymen, if a State has any thing to
fear from its inhabitants, the constitution or the laws
must be wrong. Danger cannot possibly arise from
any other cause.</p>

<p>Permit me to offer a few ideas to your minds; and
let them be the subject of more than one hour's reflection.</p>

<p>An oath creates no new obligation. A witness, who
swears to tell the whole truth, is under no new obligation
to tell the whole truth. An oath reminds him of
his duty; he swears to do as he ought to do; that is,
he adds an express promise to an implied one. A moral
obligation is not capable of addition or diminution.</p>

<p>When a man steps his foot into a State, he becomes
subject to its general laws. When he joins it as a
member, he is subject to all its laws. The act of entering
into society, binds him to submit to its laws,
and to promote its interest. Every man, who livs under
a government, is under allegiance to that government.
Ten thousand oaths do not increase the obligation
upon him to be a faithful subject.</p>

<p>But, it will be asked, how shall we distinguish between
the friends and enemies of the government? I
answer, by annihilating all distinctions. A good constitution,
and good laws, make good subjects. I challenge
the history of mankind to produce an instance of
bad subjects under a good government. The test law
in Pensylvania has produced more disorder, by making
enemies in this State, than have cursed all the union
besides. During the war, every thing gave way to
force; but the feelings and principles of war ought to
be forgotten in peace.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg153">[pg 153]</span>
Abjuration! a badge of folly, borrowed from the
dark ages of bigotry. If the government of <ins class="corr" title="Pensylvavia" id="C153">Pensylvania</ins>
is better than that of Great Britain, the subjects
will prefer it, and abjuration is perfectly nugatory. If
not, the subject will have his partialities in spite of any
solemn renunciation of a foreign power.</p>

<p>But what right has even the Legislature to deprive
any class of citizens of the benefits and emoluments of
civil government? If any men have forfeited their
lives or estates, they are no longer subjects; they ought
to be banished or hung. If not, no law ought to exclude
them from civil emoluments. If any have committed
public crimes, they are punishable; if any have
been guilty, and have not been detected, the oath, as it
now stands, obliges them to confess their guilt. To
take the oath, is an implicit acknowlegement of innocence;
to refuse it, is an implicit confession that the
person has aided and abetted the enemy. This is rank
despotism. The inquisition can do no more than force
confession from the accused.</p>

<p>I pray God to enlighten the minds of the Americans.
I wish they would shake off every badge of tyranny.
Americans!&mdash;The best way to make men
honest, is to let them enjoy equal rights and privileges;
never suspect a set of men will be rogues, and make
laws proclaiming that suspicion. Leave force to govern
the wretched vassals of European nabobs, and reconcile
subjects to your own constitutions by their excellent
nature and beneficial effects. No man will commence
enemy to a government which givs him as many
privileges as his neighbors enjoy.</p>

<p class="center"><big>SKETCHES <i>of the</i> RISE, PROGRESS <i>and</i>
CONSEQUENCES <i>of the late</i> REVOLUTION.</big></p>
<p><small>Written in the years 1787, 1788, and 1789; now republished,

<p>America was originally peopled by uncivilized
nations, which lived mostly by hunting and fishing.
The Europeans, who first visited these shores,
treating the nativs as wild beasts of the forest, which
have no property in the woods where they roam, planted
the standard of their respectiv masters where they
first landed, and in their names claimed the country by
<i>right of discovery</i>.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" title="As well may the New Zealanders, who have not yet discovered Europe, fit out a ship, land on the coast of England or France, and, finding no inhabitants but poor fishermen and peasants, claim the whole country by right of discovery." class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Prior to any settlement in North
America numerous titles of this kind were acquired by
the English, French, Spanish, and Dutch navigators,
who came hither for the purposes of fishing and trading
with the nativs. Slight as such titles were, they
were afterwards the causes of contention between the
European nations. The subjects of different princes
often laid claim to the same tract of country, because
both had discovered the same river or promontary; or
because the extent of their respectiv claims was indeterminate.</p>

<p>While the settlements in this vast uncultivated country
were inconsiderable and scattered, and the trade of
it confined to the bartering of a few trinkets for furs, a
trade carried on by a few adventurers, the interfering
of claims produced no important controversy among
<span class="pb" id="Pg155">[pg 155]</span>
the settlers or the nations of Europe. But in proportion
to the progress of population, and the growth of
the American trade, the jealousies of the nations, which
had made early discoveries and settlements on this
coast, were alarmed; ancient claims were revived; and
each power took measures to extend and secure its own
possessions at the expense of a rival.</p>

<p>By the treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the English claimed
a right of cutting logwood in the Bay of Campeachy,
in South America. In the exercise of this
right, the English merchants had frequent opportunities
of carrying on a contraband trade with the Spanish
settlements on the continent. To remedy this
evil, the Spaniards resolved to annihilate a claim,
which, though often acknowleged, had never been
clearly ascertained. To effect this design, they captured
the English vessels, which they found along the
Spanish Main, and many of the British subjects were
doomed to work in the mines of Potosi.</p>

<p>Repeated severities of this kind at length (1739)
produced a war between England and Spain. Porto
Bello was taken from the Spaniards, by Admiral Vernon.
Commodore Anson, with a squadron of ships,
sailed to the South Seas, distressed the Spanish settlements
on the western shore of America, and took a
galleon, laden with immense riches. But in 1741 a
formidable armament, destined to attack Carthagena,
under the command of Lord Cathcart, returned unsuccessful,
with the loss of upwards of twelve thousand
British soldiers and seamen; and the defeat of the expedition,
raised a clamor against the minister, Sir Robert
Walpole, which produced a change in the administration.
This change removed the scene of war to
Europe, so that America was not immediately affected
by the subsequent transactions; except that Louisburgh,
the principal fortress of Cape Breton, was taken
from the French by General Pepperell, assisted by
Commodore Warren and a body of New England
troops.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg156">[pg 156]</span>
This war was ended in 1748 by the treaty of peace
signed at Aix la Chapelle, by which restitution was
made on both sides of all places taken during the
war.</p>

<p>Peace, however, was of short duration. The French
possessed Canada, and had made considerable settlements
in Florida, claiming the country on both sides
of the Missisippi, by right of discovery. To secure and
extend their claims, they established a line of forts, on
the English possessions, from Canada to Florida. They
had secured the important pass at Niagara, and erected
a fort at the junction of the Allegany and Monongahela
rivers, called Fort Du Quesne. They took pains
to secure the friendship and assistance of the nativs, encroachments
were made upon the English possessions,
and mutual injuries succeeded. The disputes among
the settlers in America, and the measures taken by the
French to command all the trade of the St. Lawrence
river on the north, and of the Missisippi on the south,
excited a jealousy in the English nation, which soon
broke forth in open war.</p>

<p>In 1756, four expeditions were undertaken in America
against the French. One was conducted by General
Monckton, who had orders to drive the French
from the encroachments on the province of Nova
Scotia. This expedition was attended with success.
General Johnson was ordered, with a body of troops,
to take possession of Crown Point, but he did not succeed.
General Shirley commanded an expedition
against the fort at Niagara, but lost the season by
delay. General Braddock marched against fort Du
Quesne, but in penetrating through the wilderness, he
incautiously fell into an ambuscade and suffered a total
defeat. General Braddock was killed, but a part of
his troops were saved by the prudence and bravery of
General Washington, at this time a Colonel, who then
began to exhibit proofs of those military talents, by
which he afterwards conducted the armies of America
to victory, and his country to independence. The ill
<span class="pb" id="Pg157">[pg 157]</span>
success of these expeditions left the English settlements
in America exposed to the depredations of both the
French and Indians. But the war now raged in Europe
and the East Indies, and engaged the attention of
both nations in those quarters.</p>

<p>It was not until the campaign in 1758, that affairs
assumed a more favorable aspect in America. But upon
a change of administration, Mr. Pitt was appointed
Prime Minister, and the operations of war became
more vigorous and successful. General Amherst was
sent to take possession of Cape Breton; and after a
warm siege, the garrison of Louisburgh surrendered by
capitulation. General Forbes was successful in taking
possession of fort Du Quesne, which the French thought
fit to abandon. But General Abercrombie, who commanded
the troops destined to act against the French
at Crown Point and Ticonderoga, attacked the lines at
Ticonderoga, where the enemy were strongly entrenched,
and was defeated with a terrible slaughter of his
troops. After his defeat, he returned to his camp at
Lake George.</p>

<p>The next year, more effectual measures were taken
to subdue the French in America. General Prideaux
and Sir William Johnson began the operations of the
campaign by taking the French fort near Niagara.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" title="General Prideaux was killed by the bursting of a mortar, before the surrender of the French." class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
General Amherst took possession of the forts at Crown
Point and Ticonderoga, which the French had abandoned.</p>

<p>But the decisiv blow, which proved fatal to the
French interests in America, was the defeat of the
French army, and the taking of Quebec, by the brave
general Wolfe. This hero was slain in the beginning
of the action, on the plains of Abram, and Monsieur
Montcalm, the French commander, likewise lost his
life. The loss of Quebec was soon followed by the
capture of Montreal, by General Amherst, and Canada
has remained ever since in possession of the English.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg158">[pg 158]</span>
Colonel Grant, in 1761, defeated the Cherokees in
Carolina, and obliged them to sue for peace. The
next year, Martinico was taken by Admiral Rodney
and General Monkton; and also the islands of Grenada,
St. Vincents, and others. The capture of these
was soon followed by the surrender of the Havanna,
the capital of the island of Cuba.</p>

<p>In 1763, a definitiv treaty of peace was concluded at
Paris, between Great Britain, France and Spain, by
which the English ceded to the French several islands
in the West Indies, but were confirmed in the possession
of all North America on this side the Missisippi, except
New Orleans, and a small district of the neighboring
country.</p>

<p>But this war, however brilliant the success, and glorious
the event, proved the cause of great and unexpected
misfortunes to Great Britain. Engaged with
the combined powers of France and Spain, during several
years, her exertions were surprising, and her expense
immense. To discharge the debts of the nation,
the parliament was obliged to have recourse to new expedients
for raising money. Previous to the last treaty
in 1763, the parliament had been satisfied to raise a
revenue from the American Colonies by monopoly of
their trade.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the last war with France, commissioners
from many of the colonies had assembled at
Albany, and proposed that a great council should be
formed by deputies from the several colonies, which,
with a general Governor to be appointed by the
crown, should be empowered to take measures for the
common safety, and to raise money for the execution
of their designs. This proposal was not relished by
the British ministry; but in place of this plan, it was
proposed, that the Governors of the colonies, with the
assistance of one or two of their council, should assemble
and concert measures for the general defence; erect
forts, levy troops, and draw on the treasury of England
for monies that should be wanted; but the treasury to
be reimbursed by a tax on the colonies, to be laid by
<span class="pb" id="Pg159">[pg 159]</span>
the English parliament. To this plan, which would
imply an avowal of the right of parliament to tax the
colonies, the provincial assemblies objected with unshaken
firmness. It seems, therefore, that the British
parliament, <i>before</i> the war, had it in contemplation to
exercise the right they claimed of taxing the colonies at
pleasure, without permitting them to be represented.
Indeed it is obvious that they laid hold of the alarming
situation of the colonies about the year 1754, and 1755,
to force them into an acknowlegement of the right, or
to the adoption of measures that might afterwards be
drawn into precedent. The colonies however, with
an uncommon foresight and firmness, defeated all their
attempts. The war was carried on by requisitions on
the colonies for supplies of men and money, or by voluntary
contributions.</p>

<p>But no sooner was peace concluded, than the English
parliament resumed the plan of taxing the colonies;
and to justify their attempts, said, that the money
to be raised, was to be appropriated to defray the expense
of defending them in the late war.</p>

<p>The first attempt to raise a revenue in America appeared
in the memorable <i>stamp act</i>, passed March 22,
1765; by which it was enacted that certain instruments
of writing, as bills, bonds, &amp;c. should not be valid in
law, unless drawn on stamped paper, on which a duty
was laid. No sooner was this act published in America,
than it raised a general alarm. The people were
filled with apprehensions at an act which they supposed
an attack on their constitutional rights. The colonies
petitioned the king and parliament for a redress of
the grievance, and formed associations for the purpose
of preventing the importation and use of British manufactures,
until the act should be repealed. This spirited
and unanimous opposition of the Americans produced
the desired effect; and on the 18th of March,
1766, the stamp act was repealed. The news of the
repeal was received in the colonies with universal joy,
and the trade between them and Great Britain was renewed
on the most liberal footing.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg160">[pg 160]</span>
The parliament, by repealing this act, so obnoxious
to their American brethren, did not intend to lay aside
the scheme of raising a revenue in the colonies, but
merely to change the mode. Accordingly the next
year, they passed an act, laying a certain duty on glass,
tea, paper, and painters' colors; articles which were
much wanted, and not manufactured, in America.
This act kindled the resentment of the Americans, and
excited a general opposition to the measure; so that
parliament thought proper in 1770, to take off these
duties, except three pence a pound on tea. Yet this
duty, however trifling, kept alive the jealousy of the
colonists, and their opposition to parliamentary taxation
continued and increased.</p>

<p>But it must be remembered that the inconvenience
of paying the duty was not the sole, nor principal cause
of the opposition, it was the <i>principle</i> which, once admitted,
would have subjected the colonies to unlimitted
parliamentary taxation, without the privilege of
being represented. The <i>right</i>, abstractly considered,
was denied; and the smallest attempt to establish the
claim by precedent, was uniformly resisted. The Americans
could not be deceived as to the views of parliament;
for the repeal of the stamp act was accompanied
with an unequivocal declaration, "that the parliament
had a right to make laws of sufficient validity
to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever."</p>

<p>The colonies therefore entered into measures to encourage
their own manufactures, and home productions,
and to retrench the use of foreign superfluities;
while the importation of tea was prohibited. In the
royal and proprietary governments, the Governors and
people were in a state of continual warfare. Assemblies
were repeatedly called, and suddenly dissolved.
While sitting, the assemblies employed the time in dating
grievances and framing remonstrances. To inflame
these discontents, an act of parliament was passed,
ordaining that the Governors and Judges should
receive their salaries of the crown; thus making them
independent of the provincial assemblies, and <ins class="corr" title="removeaable" id="C160">removeable</ins>
only at the pleasure of the king.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg161">[pg 161]</span>
These arbitrary proceedings, with many others not
here mentioned, could not fail of producing a rupture.
The first act of violence, was the massacre at
Boston, on the evening of the fifth of March, 1770.
A body of British troops had been stationed in Boston
to awe the inhabitants, and enforce the measures of
parliament. On the fatal day, when blood was to be
shed, as a preclude to more tragic scenes, a riot was
raised among some soldiers and boys; the former aggressing
by throwing snow balls at the latter. The
bickerings and jealousies between the inhabitants and
soldiers, which had been frequent before, now became
serious. A multitude was soon collected, and the
controversy became so warm, that to disperse the
people, the troops were embodied and ordered to fire
upon the inhabitants. This fatal order was executed,
and several persons fell a sacrifice. The people
restrained their vengeance at the time; but this wanton
act of cruelty and military despotism fanned the
flame of liberty; a flame that was not to be extinguished
but by a total separation of the colonies from
their oppressiv and hostile parent.</p>

<p>In 1773, the spirit of the Americans broke out into
open violence. The Gaspee, an armed schooner, belonging
to his Britannic Majesty, had been stationed at
Providence, in Rhode Island, to prevent smuggling.
The vigilance of the commander irritated the inhabitants
to that degree, that about two hundred armed men
entered the vessel at night, compelled the officers and
men to go on shore, and set fire to the schooner. A
reward of five hundred pounds, offered by government
for apprehending any of the persons concerned in this
daring act, produced no effectual discovery.</p>

<p>About this time, the discovery and publication of
some private confidential letters, written by the royal
officers in Boston, to persons in office in England,
served to confirm the apprehensions of the Americans,
with respect to the designs of the British government.
It was now made obvious that more effectual measures
would be taken to establish the supremacy of the
British parliament over the colonies. The letters recommended
<span class="pb" id="Pg162">[pg 162]</span>
decisiv measures, and the writers were
charged, by the exasperated Americans, with betraying
their trust and the people they governed.</p>

<p>As the resolutions of the colonies not to import or
consume tea, had, in a great measure, deprived the
English government of a revenue from this quarter, the
parliament formed a scheme of introducing tea into
America, under cover of the East India company. For
this purpose an act was passed, enabling the company
to export all sorts of teas, duty free, to any place whatever.
The company departed from their usual mode
of business and became their own exporters. Several
ships were freighted with teas, and sent to the American
colonies, and factors were appointed to receive and
dispose of their cargoes.</p>

<p>The Americans, determined to oppose the revenue
system of the English parliament in every possible
shape, considered the attempt of the East India company
to evade the resolutions of the colonies, and dispose
of teas in America, as an indirect mode of taxation,
sanctioned by the authority of parliament. The people
assembled in various places, and in the large commercial
towns, took measures to prevent the landing of
the teas. Committees were appointed, and armed
with extensiv powers to inspect merchants' books, to
propose tests, and make use of other expedients to frustrate
the designs of the East India company. The
same spirit pervaded the people from New Hampshire
to Georgia. In some places, the consignees of the teas
were intimidated so far as to relinquish their appointments,
or to enter into engagements not to act in that
capacity. The cargo sent to South Carolina was stored,
the consignees being restrained from offering the tea
for sale. In other provinces, the ships were sent back
without discharging their cargoes.</p>

<p>But in Boston the tea shared a more violent fate.
Sensible that no local measures could prevent its being
landed, and that if once landed, it would be disposed
of; a number of men in disguise, on the 18th of December
1773, entered the ships and threw overboard
<span class="pb" id="Pg163">[pg 163]</span>
three hundred and forty chests of it, which was the
proportion belonging to the East India company. No
sooner did the news of this destruction of the tea reach
Great Britain, than the parliament determined to punish
that devoted town. On the king's laying the American
papers before them, a bill was brought in and
passed, "to discontinue the landing and discharging,
lading and shipping of goods, wares and merchandizes
at the town of Boston, or within the harbor."</p>

<p>This act, passed March 25, 1774, called the Boston
port bill, threw the inhabitants of Massachusetts into
the greatest consternation. The town of Boston passed
a resolution, expressing their sense of this oppressiv
measure, and a desire that all the colonies would concur
to stop all importation from Great Britain. Most
of the colonies entered into spirited resolutions, on this
occasion, to unite with Massachusetts in a firm opposition
to the unconstitutional measures of the parliament.
The first of June, the day on which the port bill was
to take place, was appointed to be kept as a day of humiliation,
fasting and prayer throughout the colonies,
to seek the divine direction and aid, in that critical and
gloomy juncture of affairs.</p>

<p>During the height of the consternation and confusion
which the Boston port bill occasioned; at the very time
when a town meeting was sitting to consider of it, General
Gage, who had been appointed to the government
of Massachusetts, arrived in the harbor. His arrival
however did not allay the popular ferment, or check the
progress of the measures then taking, to unite the colonies
in opposition to the oppressiv act of parliament.</p>

<p>But the port bill was not the only act that alarmed
the apprehensions of the Americans. Determined to
compel the province of Massachusetts to submit to their
laws, parliament passed an act for "the better regulating
government in the province of Massachusetts Bay."
The object of this act was to alter the government, as
it stood on the charter of king William, to take the appointment
of the executiv out of the hands of the people,
and place it in the crown; thus making even the
<span class="pb" id="Pg164">[pg 164]</span>
judges and sheriffs dependent on the king, and removeable
only at his pleasure.</p>

<p>This act was soon followed by another, which ordained
that any person, indicted for murder, or other
capital offence, committed in aiding the magistrates in
executing the laws, might be sent by the governor either
to another colony, or to Great Britain for his trial.</p>

<p>This was soon followed by the Quebec bill; which
extended the bounds of that province, and granted
many privileges to the Roman Catholics. The object
of this bill was, to secure the attachment of that
province to the crown of England, and prevent its
joining the colonies in their resistance to the laws of
parliament.</p>

<p>But these measures did not intimidate the Americans.
On the other hand they served to confirm their
former apprehensions of the evil designs of government,
and to unite the colonies in their opposition. A correspondence
of opinion with respect to the unconstitutional
acts of parliament, produced a uniformity of
proceedings in the colonies. The people generally
<ins class="corr" title="concurrred" id="C164">concurred</ins> in a proposition for holding a Congress by
deputation from the several colonies, in order to concert
measures for the preservation of their rights. Deputies
were accordingly appointed, and met at Philadelphia,
on the 26th of October, 1774.</p>

<p>In this first Congress, the proceedings were cool, deliberate
and loyal; but marked with unanimity and
firmness. Their first act was a declaration, or state of
their claims as to the enjoyment of all the rights of
British subjects, and particularly that of taxing themselves
exclusivly, and of regulating the internal police
of the colonies. They also drew up a petition to the
king, complaining of their grievances and praying for
a repeal of the unconstitutional and oppressiv acts of
parliament. They signed an association to suspend the
importation of British goods, and the exportation of
American produce, until their grievances should be redressed.
They sent an address to the inhabitants of
Great Britain, and another to the people of America;
<span class="pb" id="Pg165">[pg 165]</span>
in the former of which they enumerated the oppressiv
steps of parliament, and called on their British brethren
not to aid the ministry in enslaving their American
subjects; and in the latter, they endeavored to confirm
the people in a spirited and unanimous determination
to defend their constitutional rights.</p>

<p>In the mean time, every thing in Massachusetts wore
the appearance of opposition by force. A new council
for the Governor had been appointed by the crown.
New judges were appointed, and attempted to proceed
in the execution of their office. But the juries refused to
be sworn under them; in some counties, the people assembled
to prevent the courts from proceeding to business;
and in Berkshire they succeeded, setting an example
of resistance that has since been followed, in violation
of the laws of the State.</p>

<p>In this situation of affairs, the day for the annual
muster of the militia approached. General Gage, apprehensiv
of some violence, had the precaution to seize
the magazines of ammunition and stores at Cambridge
and Charlestown, and lodged them in Boston. This
measure, with the fortifying of that neck of land which
joins Boston to the main land at Roxbury, caused a
universal alarm and ferment. Several thousand people
assembled, and it was with difficulty they could be restrained
from falling upon the British troops.</p>

<p>On this occasion, an assembly of delegates from all
the towns in Suffolk county, was called; and several
spirited resolutions were agreed to. These resolutions
were prefaced with a declaration of allegiance; but
they breathed a spirit of freedom that does honor to
the delegates. They declared that the late acts of parliament
and the proceedings of General Gage, were
glaring infractions of their rights and liberties, which
their duty called them to defend by all lawful means.</p>

<p>This assembly remonstrated against the fortification
of Boston neck, and against the Quebec bill; and resolved
upon a suspension of commerce, and encouragement
of arts and manufactures, the holding of a provincial
Congress, and a submission to the measures
<span class="pb" id="Pg166">[pg 166]</span>
which should be recommended by the Continental
Congress. They recommended that the collectors of
taxes should not pay any money into the treasury, without
further orders; they also recommended peace and
good order, as they meant to act merely upon the defensiv.</p>

<p>In answer to their remonstrance, General Gage assured
them that he had no intention to prevent the free
egress and regress of the inhabitants to and from the
town of Boston, and that he would not suffer any person
under his command to injure the person or property
of any of his majesty's subjects.</p>

<p>Previous to this, a General Assembly had been summoned
to meet; and notwithstanding the writs had
been countermanded by the Governor's proclamation,
on account of the violence of the times and the resignation
of several of the new counsellors, yet representativs
were chosen by the people, who met at Salem, resolved
themselves into a provincial Congress, and adjourned
to Concord.</p>

<p>This Congress addressed the Governor with a rehearsal
of their distresses, and took the necessary steps
for defending their rights. They regulated the militia,
made provision for supplying the treasury, and furnishing
the people with arms; and such was the enthusiasm
and union of the people, that the recommendations of
the provincial Congress had the force of laws.</p>

<p>General Gage was incensed at these measures; he
declared, in his answer to the address, that Britain
could never harbor the black design of enslaving her
subjects, and published a proclamation in which he insinuated
that such proceedings amounted to rebellion.
He also ordered barracks to be erected for the soldiers;
but he found difficulty in procuring laborers, either in
Boston or New York.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 1775, the fishery bills were passed
in parliament, by which the colonies were prohibited
to trade with Great Britain, Ireland or the West Indies,
or to take fish on the banks of Newfoundland.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg167">[pg 167]</span>
In the distresses to which these acts of parliament reduced
the town of Boston, the unanimity of the colonies
was remarkable, in the large supplies of provision,
furnished by the inhabitants of different towns from
New Hampshire to Georgia, and shipped to the relief
of the sufferers.</p>

<p>Preparations began to be made, to oppose by force,
the execution of these acts of parliament. The militia
of the country were trained to the use of arms;
great encouragement was given for the manufacture of
gunpowder, and measures were taken to obtain all
kinds of military stores.</p>

<p>In February, Colonel Leslie was sent with a detachment
of troops from Boston, to take possession of some
cannon at Salem. But the people had intelligence of
the design, took up the draw bridge in that town, and
prevented the troops from passing, until the cannon
were secured; so that the expedition failed.</p>

<p>In April, Colonel Smith, and Major Pitcairn were
sent with a body of about nine hundred troops, to destroy
the military stores which had been collected at
Concord, about twenty miles from Boston. It is believed,
that another object of this expedition, was to
seize on the persons of Messrs. Hancock and Adams,
who, by their spirited exertions, had rendered themselves
very obnoxious to General Gage. At Lexington,
the militia were collected on a green, to oppose the
incursion of the British forces. These were fired upon
by the British troops, and eight men killed on the
spot.</p>

<p>The militia were dispersed, and the troops proceeded
to Concord; where they destroyed a few stores. But
on their return, they were incessantly harrassed by the
Americans, who, inflamed with just resentment, fired
upon them from houses and fences, and pursued them
to Boston. The loss of the British in this expedition,
in killed, wounded and prisoners, was two hundred and
seventy three men.</p>

<p>Here was spilt the <i>first blood</i> in the late war; a war
which severed America from the British empire. <i>Lexington</i>
<span class="pb" id="Pg168">[pg 168]</span>
opened the first scene of this great drama, which,
in its progress, exhibited the most illustrious characters
and events, and closed with a revolution, equally glorious
for the actors, and important in its consequences to
mankind.</p>

<p>This battle roused all America. The militia collected
from all quarters, and Boston, in a few days was
besieged by twenty thousand men. A stop was put to
all intercourse between the town and country, and the
inhabitants were reduced to great want of provisions.
General Gage promised to let the people depart, if they
would deliver up their arms. The people complied;
but when the General had obtained their arms, the
perfidious man refused to let the people go.</p>

<p>In the mean time, a small number of men, to the
amount of about two hundred and forty, under the
command of Colonel Allen, and Colonel Easton, without
any public orders, surprised and took the British
garrisons at Ticonderoga and Crown Point, without
the loss of a man on either side.</p>

<p>During these transactions, the Generals Howe, Burgoyne,
and Clinton, arrived at Boston from England,
with a number of troops. In June following, our
troops attempted to fortify Bunker's hill, which lies
near Charlestown, and but a mile and an half from
Boston. They had, during the night, thrown up a
small breast work, which sheltered them from the fire
of the British cannon. But the next morning, the
British army was sent to drive them from the hill, and,
landing under cover of their cannon, they set fire to
Charlestown, which was consumed, and marched to
attack our troops in the entrenchments. A severe engagement
ensued, in which the British, according to
their own accounts, had seven hundred and forty killed,
and eleven hundred and fifty wounded. They
were repulsed at first, and thrown into disorder; but
they finally carried the fortification, with the point of
the bayonet. The Americans suffered a small loss,
compared with the British; the whole loss in killed,
wounded, and prisoners, being but about four hundred
and fifty.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg169">[pg 169]</span>
The loss most lamented on this bloody day, was
that of Dr. Warren, who was at this time a Major
General, and commanded the troops on this occasion.
He died like a brave man, fighting valiantly at the
head of his party, in a little redoubt at the right of our
lines.</p>

<p>General Warren, who had rendered himself conspicuous
by his universal merit, abilities, and eloquence,
had been a delegate to the first general Congress, and
was at this time President of the provincial Congress
of Massachusetts. But quitting the humane and peaceable
walk of his profession as a physician, and breaking
through the endearing ties of family connexions, he
proved himself equally calculated for the field, as for
public business or private study.</p>

<p>About this, time, the Continental Congress appointed
George Washington, Esq. a nativ of Virginia, to
the chief command of the American arm. This
gentleman had been a distinguished and successful officer
in the preceding war, and he seemed destined by
heaven to be the savior of his country. He accepted
the appointment with a diffidence which was a proof
of his prudence and his greatness. He refused any pay
for eight years laborious and arduous service; and by
his matchless skill, fortitude and perseverance, conducted
America thro indescribeable difficulties, to independence
and peace.</p>

<p>While true merit is esteemed, or virtue honored,
mankind will never cease to revere the memory of this
Hero; and while gratitude remains in the human
breast, the praises of <span class="smcap">Washington</span> shall dwell on every
American tongue.</p>

<p>General Washington, with other officers appointed
by Congress, arrived at Cambridge, and took command
of the American army in July. From this
time, the affairs of America began to assume the appearance
of a regular and general opposition to the
forces of Great Britain.</p>

<p>In autumn, a body of troops, under the command
of General Montgomery, besieged and took the garrison
<span class="pb" id="Pg170">[pg 170]</span>
at St. John's, which commands the entrance into
Canada. The prisoners amounted to about seven
hundred. General Montgomery pursued his success,
and took Montreal; and designed to push his victories
to Quebec.</p>

<p>A body of troops, commanded by General Arnold,
was ordered to march to Canada, by the river Kennebeck,
and through the wilderness. After suffering every
hardship, and the most distressing hunger, they arrived
in Canada, and were joined by General Montgomery,
before Quebec. This city, which was commanded
by Governor Carleton, was immediately besieged.
But there being little hope of taking the town
by a siege, it was determined to storm it.</p>

<p>The attack was made on the last day of December,
but proved unsuccessful, and fatal to the brave General,
who, with his aid, was killed in attempting to
scale the walls.</p>

<p>Of the three divisions which attacked the town, one
only entered, and that was obliged to surrender to superior
force. After this defeat, General Arnold, who
now commanded the troops, continued some months
before Quebec, altho his troops suffered incredibly by
cold and sickness. But the next spring, the Americans
were obliged to retreat from Canada.</p>

<p>About this time, the large and flourishing town of
Norfolk, in Virginia, was wantonly burnt by order of lord
Dunmore, the then royal Governor of that province.</p>

<p>General Gage went to England in September, and
was succeeded in the command, by General Howe.</p>

<p>Falmouth, a considerable town in the province of
Maine, in Massachusetts, shared the fate of Norfolk;
being laid in ashes by order of the British admiral.</p>

<p>The British king entered into treaties with some of
the German princes for about seventeen thousand men,
who were to be sent to America the next year, to assist
in subduing the colonies. The parliament also passed
an act, forbidding all intercourse with America; and
while they repealed the Boston port and fishery bills,
they declared all American property on the high seas,
<span class="pb" id="Pg171">[pg 171]</span>
forfeited to the captors. This act induced Congress
to change the mode of carrying on the war; and measures
were taken to annoy the enemy in Boston. For
this purpose, batteries were opened on several hills,
from whence shot and bombs were thrown into the
town. But the batteries which were opened on Dorchester
point had the best effect, and soon obliged General
Howe to abandon the town. In March, 1776,
the British troops embarked for Halifax, and General
Washington entered the town in triumph.</p>

<p>In the ensuing summer, a small squadron of ships
commanded by Sir Peter Parker, and a body of troops
under the Generals Clinton and Cornwallis, attempted
to take Charleston, the capital of South Carolina. The
ships made a violent attack upon the fort on Sullivan's
Island, but were repulsed with great loss, and the expedition
was abandoned.</p>

<p>In July, Congress published their declaration of independence,
which separated America from Great
Britain. This great event took place two hundred and
eighty four years after the first discovery of America by
Columbus; one hundred and sixty six, from the first
effectual settlement in Virginia; and one hundred and
fifty six from the first settlement of Plymouth, in Massachusetts,
which were the earliest English settlements
in America.</p>

<p>Just after this declaration, General Howe with a
powerful force arrived near New York, and landed the
troops upon Staten Island. General Washington was
in New York with about thirteen thousand men, who
were encamped either in the city or the neighboring
fortifications.</p>

<p>The operations of the British began by the action on
Long Island, in the month of August. The Americans
were defeated, and General Sullivan and lord
Sterling, with a large body of men, were made prisoners.
The night after the engagement, a retreat was
ordered, and executed with such silence, that the Americans
left the island without alarming their enemies,
and without loss.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg172">[pg 172]</span>
In September, the city of New York was abandoned
by the American army, and taken by the British.</p>

<p>In November, Fort Washington, on York Island,
was taken, and more than two thousand men made
prisoners. Fort Lee, opposit to Fort Washington, on
the Jersey shore, was soon after taken, but the garrison
escaped.</p>

<p>About the same time, General Clinton was sent
with a body of troops to take possession of Rhode
Island; and succeeded. In addition to all these losses
and defeats, the American army suffered by desertion,
and more by sickness, which was epidemic, and very
mortal.</p>

<p>The northern army at Ticonderoga, was in a disagreeable
situation, particularly after the battle on Lake
Champlain, in which the American force, consisting of
a few light vessels, under the command of Generals
Arnold and Waterbury, was totally dispersed. But
General Carleton, instead of pursuing his victory, landed
at Crown Point, reconnoitered our posts at Ticonderoga
and Mount Independence, and returned to
winter quarters in Canada.</p>

<p>The American army might now be said to be no
more. All that now remained of an army, which at
the opening of the campaign, amounted to at least
twenty five thousand men, did not now exceed three
thousand. The term of their engagements being expired,
they returned, in large bodies, to their families
and friends; the few, who from personal attachment,
local circumstances, or superior perseverance and bravery,
continued with the Generals Washington and Lee,
were too inconsiderable to appear formidable in the
view of a powerful and victorious enemy.</p>

<p>In this alarming and critical situation of affairs,
General Lee, through an imprudent carelessness, which
ill became a man in his important station, was captured
by a party of the British light horse, commanded
by Colonel Harcourt; this unfortunate circumstance
gave a severe shock to the remaining hopes of the little
army, and rendered their situation truly distressing.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg173">[pg 173]</span>
While these things were transacting in New Jersey,
General Washington, far from being discouraged by
the loss of General Lee, and always ready to improve
every advantage to raise the drooping spirits of his
handful of men, had made a stand on the Pensylvania
side of the Delaware. Here he collected his scattered
forces, called in the assistance of the Pensylvania
militia, and on the night of the 25th of December,
(1776) when the enemy were lulled into security by
the idea of his weakness, and by the inclemency of the
night, which was remarkably boisterous, as well as by
the fumes of a Christmas eve, he crossed the river, and
at the breaking of day, marched down to Trenton, and
so completely surprised them, that the greater part of
the detachment which were stationed at this place, surrendered
after a short resistance. The horsemen and a
few others made their escape at the opposit end of the
town. Upwards of nine hundred Hessians were taken
prisoners at this time.</p>

<p>This successful expedition first gave a favorable turn
to our affairs, which, after this, seemed to brighten
thro the whole course of the war. Soon after, General
Washington attacked the British troops at Princeton,
and obtained a complete victory; not, however,
without being bravely opposed by Colonel Mawhood.</p>

<p>The address in planning and executing these enterprises,
reflected the highest honor on the commander,
and the success revived the desponding hopes of America.
The loss of General Mercer, a gallant officer, at
Princeton, was the principal circumstance that allayed
the joys of victory.</p>

<p>The following year, 1777, was distinguished by very
memorable events, in favor of America. On the opening
of the campaign, Governor Tryon was sent with
a body of troops, to destroy the stores at Danbury, in
Connecticut. This plan was executed, and the town
mostly burnt. The enemy suffered in their retreat,
and the Americans lost General Wooster, a brave and
experienced officer.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg174">[pg 174]</span>
General Prescot was taken from his quarters, on
Rhode Island, by the address and enterprise of Colonel
Barton, and conveyed prisoner to the continent.</p>

<p>General Burgoyne, who commanded the northern
British army, took possession of Ticonderoga, which
had been abandoned by the Americans. He pushed
his successes, crossed Lake George, and encamped upon
the banks of the Hudson, near Saratoga. His progress,
however, was checked, by the defeat of Colonel Baum,
near Bennington, in which the undisciplined militia of
Vermont, under General Stark, displayed unexampled
bravery, and captured almost the whole detachment.</p>

<p>The militia assembled from all parts of New England,
to stop the progress of General Burgoyne.</p>

<p>These, with the regular troops, formed a respectable
army, commanded by General Gates. After two severe
actions, in which the Generals Lincoln and Arnold,
behaved with uncommon gallantry, and were
wounded, General Burgoyne found himself enclosed
with brave troops, and was forced to surrender his
whole army, amounting, according to some, to ten
thousand, and according to others, to five thousand
seven hundred and fifty two men, into the hands of
the Americans. This memorable event happened on
the 17th of October, 1777; and diffused an universal
joy over America, and laid a foundation for the treaty
with France.</p>

<p>But before these transactions, the main body of the
British forces had embarked at New York, sailed up the
Chesapeak, and landed at the head of Elk river. The
army soon began their march for Philadelphia. General
Washington had determined to oppose them, and
for this purpose made a stand, first at Red Clay Creek,
and then upon the heights, near Brandywine Creek.
Here the armies engaged, and the Americans were
overpowered, and suffered great loss. The enemy soon
pursued their march, and took possession of Philadelphia
towards the close of September.</p>

<p>Not long after, the two armies were again engaged
at Germantown, and in the beginning of the action,
<span class="pb" id="Pg175">[pg 175]</span>
the Americans had the advantage; but by some unlucky
accident, the fortune of the day was turned in
favor of the British. Both sides suffered considerable
losses; on the side of the Americans, was General
Nash.</p>

<p>In an attack upon the forts at Mud Island and Red
Bank, the Hessians were unsuccessful, and their commander,
Colonel Donop, killed. The British also lost
the Augusta, a ship of the line. But the forts were
afterwards taken, and the navigation of the Delaware
opened. General Washington was reinforced, with
part of the troops which had composed the northern
army, under General Gates; and both armies retired
to winter quarters.</p>

<p>In October, the same month in which General Burgoyne
was taken at Saratoga, General Vaughan, with
a small fleet, sailed up Hudson's river, and wantonly
burnt Kingston, a beautiful Dutch settlement, on the
west side of the river.</p>

<p>The beginning of the next year, 1778, was distinguished
by a treaty of alliance between France and America;
by which we obtained a powerful and generous
ally. When the English ministry were informed
that this treaty was on foot, they dispatched
commissioners to America, to attempt a reconciliation.
But America would not now accept their
offers. Early in the spring, Count de Estaing, with a
fleet of fifteen sail of the line, was sent by the court of
France to assist America.</p>

<p>General Howe left the army, and returned to England;
the command then devolved upon Sir Henry
Clinton.</p>

<p>In June, the British army left Philadelphia, and
marched for New York. On their march they were
annoyed by the Americans; and at Monmouth, a very
regular action took place, between part of the armies;
the enemy were repulsed with great loss, and had General
Lee obeyed his orders, a signal victory must have
been obtained. General Lee, for his ill conduct that
<span class="pb" id="Pg176">[pg 176]</span>
day, was suspended, and was never afterwards permitted
to join the army.</p>

<p>General Lee's conduct, at several times before this,
had been very suspicious. In December 1776, he lay
at Chatham, about eleven miles from Elizabeth Town,
with a brigade of troops, when a great quantity of
baggage was stored at Elizabeth Town, under a guard
of only five hundred Hessians. General Lee was apprised
of this, and might have surprised the guard and
taken the baggage. But he neglected the opportunity,
and after several marches and counter marches between
Troy, Chatham and Morristown, he took up his
quarters at or near White's tavern, where he was surprised
and taken prisoner by a party of the British
horse. He was heard to say repeatedly, that General
Washington would ruin a fine army. It was suspected
that he had designs to supplant the General, and his
friends attempted to place him at the head of the army.
General Washington's prudent delays and cautious
movements afforded General Lee's friends many
opportunities to spread reports unfavorable to his character.
It was insinuated, with some success, that General
Washington wanted courage and abilities. Reports
of this kind, at one time, rendered General Lee
very popular, and it is supposed he wished to frustrate
General Washington's plans, in order to increase the
suspicions already entertained of his generalship, and
turn the public clamor in his own favor. His conduct
at Monmouth, must have proceeded from such a design;
for he commanded the flower of the American
army, and was not destitute of courage.</p>

<p>In August, General Sullivan, with a large body of
troops, attempted to take possession of Rhode Island,
but did not succeed. Soon after, the stores and shipping
at Bedford in Massachusetts, were burnt by a party
of the British troops. The same year, Savannah, then
the capital of Georgia, was taken by the British, under
the command of Colonel Campbell.</p>

<p>In the following year (1779) General Lincoln was
appointed to the command of the southern army.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg177">[pg 177]</span>
Governor Tryon and Sir George Collier made an
incursion into Connecticut, and burnt, with wanton barbarity,
the towns of Fairfield and Norwalk. But the
American arms were crowned with success, in a bold
attack upon Stoney Point, which was surprised and
taken by General Wayne, in the night of the 15th of
July. Five hundred men were made prisoners, with
little loss on either side.</p>

<p>A party of British forces attempted this summer, to
build a fort on Penobscot river, for the purpose of cutting
timber in the neighboring forests. A plan was
laid by Massachusetts, to dislodge them, and a considerable
fleet collected for the purpose. But the plan
failed of success, and the whole marine force fell into
the hands of the British, except some vessels which were
burnt by the Americans themselves.</p>

<p>In October, General Lincoln and Count de Estaing
made an assault upon Savannah; but they were repulsed
with considerable loss. In this action, the celebrated
Polish Count Pulaski, who had acquired the reputation
of a brave soldier, was mortally wounded.</p>

<p>In this summer, General Sullivan marched with a
body of troops, into the Indians' country, and burnt and
destroyed all their provisions and settlements that fell
in their way.</p>

<p>On the opening of the campaign, the next year,
(1780) the British troops left Rhode Island. An expedition
under General Clinton and Lord Cornwallis,
was undertaken against Charleston, South Carolina,
where General Lincoln commanded. This town, after
a close siege of about six weeks, was surrendered to
the British commander; and General Lincoln, and the
whole American garrison were made prisoners.</p>

<p>General Gates was appointed to the command in
the southern department, and another army collected.
In August, Lord Cornwallis attacked the American
troops at Camden, in South Carolina, and routed
them with considerable loss. He afterwards marched
through the southern States, and supposed them entirely
subdued.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg178">[pg 178]</span>
The same summer, the British troops made frequent
incursions from New York into the Jersies; ravaging
and plundering the country.</p>

<p>In July, a French fleet, under Monsieur d'Ternay,
with a body of land forces, commanded by Count de
Rochambeau, arrived at Rhode Island, to the great joy
of the Americans.</p>

<p>This year was also distinguished by the infamous
treason of General Arnold. General Washington having
some business to transact at Wethersfield, in Connecticut,
left Arnold to command the important post of
West Point; which guards a pass in Hudson's river,
about sixty miles from New York. Arnold's conduct
in the city of Philadelphia, the preceding winter, had
been censured; and the treatment he received in consequence,
had given him offence.</p>

<p>He determined to take revenge; and for this purpose,
he entered into a negociation with Sir Henry
Clinton, to deliver West Point, and the army, into the
hands of the British. While General Washington was
absent, he dismounted the cannon in some of the forts,
and took other steps to render the taking of the post
easy for the enemy.</p>

<p>But by a providential discovery, the whole plan was
defeated. Major Andre, aid to General Clinton, a
brave officer, who had been sent up the river as a spy,
to concert the plan of operations with Arnold, was
taken, condemned by a court martial, and executed.
Arnold made his escape, by getting on board the Vulture,
a British vessel, which lay in the river. His conduct
has stamped him with infamy; and, like all traitors,
he is despised by all mankind. General Washington
arrived in camp just after Arnold had made his
escape, and restored order in the garrison.</p>

<p>After the defeat of General Gates in Carolina, General
Greene was appointed to the command in the
southern department. From this period, things in that
quarter wore a more favorable aspect. Colonel Tarleton,
the activ commander of the British legion, was
defeated by General Morgan, the intrepid commander
of the rifle men.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg179">[pg 179]</span>
After a variety of movements, the two armies met at
Guilford, in Carolina. Here was one of the best
fought actions during the war. General Greene and
Lord Cornwallis exerted themselves at the head of their
respectiv armies; and although the Americans were
obliged to retire from the field of battle, yet the British
army suffered an immense loss, and could not pursue
the victory. This action happened on the 15th March,
1781.</p>

<p>In the spring, Arnold the traitor, who was made a
Brigadier General in the British service, with a small
number of troops, sailed for Virginia, and plundered
the country. This called the attention of the French
fleet to that quarter; and a naval engagement took
place between the English and French, in which some
of the English ships were much damaged, and one entirely
disabled.</p>

<p>After the battle of Guilford, General Greene moved
towards South Carolina, to drive the British from their
posts in that State. Here Lord Rawdon obtained an
inconsiderable advantage over the Americans, near
Camden. But General Greene more than recovered
this advantage, by the brilliant and successful action at
the Eutaw Springs; where General Marian distinguished
himself, and the brave Colonel Washington was
wounded and taken prisoner.</p>

<p>Lord Cornwallis, finding General Greene successful
in Carolina, marched to Virginia, collected his forces,
and fortified himself in Yorktown. In the mean time
Arnold made an incursion into Connecticut, burnt a
part of New London, took Fort Griswold by storm,
and put the garrison to the sword. The garrison consisted
chiefly of men suddenly collected from the little
town of Groton, which, by the savage cruelty of the
British officer who commanded the attack, lost, in one
hour, almost all its heads of families. The brave
Colonel Ledyard, who commanded the fort, was slain
with his own sword, after he had surrendered.</p>

<p>The Marquis de la Fayette, the brave and generous
nobleman, whose services command the gratitude of
<span class="pb" id="Pg180">[pg 180]</span>
every American, had been dispatched with about two
thousand light infantry, from the main army, to watch
the motions of lord Cornwallis in Virginia. He prosecuted
this expedition with the greatest military ability.
Although his force was much inferior to that of the
enemy, he obliged them to leave Richmond and Williamsburgh,
and to seek protection under their shipping.</p>

<p>About the last of August, Count de Grasse arrived
with a large fleet in the Chesapeak, and blocked up
the British troops at Yorktown. Admiral Greaves,
with a British fleet, appeared off the Capes, and an
action succeeded; but it was not decisiv.</p>

<p>General Washington had before this time moved
the main body of his army, together with the French
troops, to the southward; and as soon as he heard of
the arrival of the French fleet in the Chesapeak, he
made rapid marches to the head of Elk, where embarking,
the troops soon arrived at Yorktown.</p>

<p>A close siege immediately commenced, and was carried
on with such vigor, by the combined forces of America
and France, that lord Cornwallis was obliged to
surrender. This glorious event which took place on
the 19th of October, 1781, decided the contest in favor
of America; and laid the foundation of a general
peace.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" title="It has been controverted whether the capture of General Cornwallis was the result of a plan preconcerted between General Washington and Count de Grasse; or rather whether the arrival of the Count in the Chesapeak was predetermined and expected by General Washington, and consequently all the preparations to attack New York a mere finesse to deceive the enemy; or whether the real intention was against New York, and the siege of Yorktown planned upon the unexpected arrival of the French fleet in the bay...." class="fnanchor">[46]</a> </p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg181">[pg 181]</span>
A few months after the surrender of Cornwallis, the
British evacuated all their posts in South Carolina and
Georgia, and retired to the main army in New York.</p>

<p>The next spring, (1782) Sir Guy Carleton arrived in
New York, and took the command of the British army,
in America. Immediately on his arrival, he acquainted
General Washington and Congress, that negociations
for a peace had been commenced at Paris.</p>

<p>On the 30th of November, 1782, the provisional
articles of peace were signed at Paris; by which Great
Britain acknowleged the independence and sovereignty
of the United States of America; and these articles
were afterwards ratified by a definitiv treaty.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg182">[pg 182]</span>
Thus ended a long and arduous conflict, in which
Great Britain expended near an hundred millions of
money, with an hundred thousand lives, and won nothing.
America endured every cruelty and distress from
her enemies; lost many lives and much treasure; but
delivered herself from a foreign dominion, and gained
a rank among the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>Holland acknowleged the independence of the United
States on the 19th of April, 1782; Sweden, February
5th, 1783; Denmark, the 25th of February;
Spain, in March, and Russia in July, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg183">[pg 183]</span>
No sooner was peace restored by the definitiv treaty,
and the British troops withdrawn from the country,
than the United States began to experience the defects
of their general government. While an enemy was
in the country, fear, which had first impelled the colonies
to associate in mutual defence, continued to operate
as a band of political union. It gave to the resolutions
and recommendations of Congress the force of
laws, and generally commanded a ready acquiescence
on the part of the State legislatures. Articles of confederation
and perpetual union had been framed in
Congress, and submitted to the consideration of the
States, in the year 1778. Some of the States immediately
acceded to them; but others, which had not
unappropriated lands, hesitated to subscribe a compact,
which would giv an advantage to the States which
possessed large tracts of unlocated lands, and were thus
capable of a great superiority in wealth and population.
All objections however had been overcome, and by the
accession of Maryland in March, 1781, the articles of
confederation were ratified, as the frame of government
for the United States.</p>

<p>These articles, however were framed during the rage
of war, when a principle of common safety supplied
the place of a coerciv power in government; by men
who could have had no experience in the art of governing
an extensiv country, and under circumstances
the most critical and embarrassing. To have offered
to the people at that time, a system of government
armed with the powers necessary to regulate and control
the contending interests of thirteen States, and the
possessions of millions of people, might have raised a
jealousy between the States or in the minds of the people
at large, that would have weakened the operations
of war, and perhaps have rendered a union impracticable.
Hence the numerous defects of the confederation.</p>

<p>On the conclusion of peace, these defects began to
be felt. Each State assumed the right of disputing the
propriety of the resolutions of Congress, and the interest
<span class="pb" id="Pg184">[pg 184]</span>
of an individual State was placed in opposition
to the common interest of the union. In addition to
this source of division, a jealousy of the powers of Congress
began to be excited in the minds of people.</p>

<p>This jealousy of the privileges of freemen, had been
roused by the oppressiv acts of the British parliament;
and no sooner had the danger from this quarter ceased,
than the fears of people changed their object, and were
turned against their own rulers.</p>

<p>In this situation, there were not wanting men of industry
and talents, who had been enemies to the revolution,
and who embraced the opportunity to multiply
the apprehensions of people and increase the popular
discontents. A remarkable instance of this happened
in Connecticut. As soon as the tumults of war had
subsided, an attempt was made to convince the people,
that the act of Congress passed in 1778, granting to the
officers of the army, half pay for life, was highly unjust
and tyrannical; and that it was but the first step towards
the establishment of pensions and an uncontrolable
despotism. The act of Congress, passed in 1783,
commuting half pay for life for five years full pay, was
designed to appease the apprehensions of people, and to
convince them that this gratuity was intended merely
to indemnify the officers for their losses by the depreciation
of the paper currency; and not to establish a
precedent for the granting of pensions. This act,
however, did not satisfy the people, who supposed that
the officers had been generally indemnified for the loss
of their pay, by the grants made them from time to
time by the legislatures of the several States. Besides
the act, while it gave five years full pay to the officers,
allowed but one year's pay to the privates; a distinction
which had great influence in exciting and continuing
the popular ferment, and one that turned a large
share of the public rage against the officers themselves.</p>

<p>The moment an alarm was raised respecting this act
of Congress, the enemies of our independence became
activ in blowing up the flame, by spreading reports unfavorable
to the general government, and tending to
<span class="pb" id="Pg185">[pg 185]</span>
create public dissensions. Newspapers, in some parts
of the country, were filled with inflammatory publications;
while false reports and groundless insinuations
were industriously circulated to the prejudice of Congress
and the officers of the late army. Among a people
feelingly alive to every thing that could affect the
rights for which they had been contending, these reports
could not fail of having a powerful effect; the
clamor soon became general; the officers of the army,
it was believed, had attempted to raise their fortunes on
the distresses of their fellow citizens, and Congress become
the tyrants of their country.</p>

<p>Connecticut was the seat of this uneasiness; altho
other States were much agitated on the occasion. But
the inhabitants of that State, accustomed to order and
a due subordination to the laws, did not proceed to
outrages; they took their usual mode of collecting the
sense of the State; assembled in town meetings; appointed
committees to meet in convention, and consult
what measures should be adopted to procure a redress
of their grievances. In this convention, which was
held at Middletown, some nugatory resolves were passed,
exploiting a disapprobation of the half pay act, and
the subsequent commutation of the grant for five years
whole pay. The same spirit also discovered itself in
the assembly, at their October session, in 1783. A remonstrance
against the acts in favor of the officers, was
framed in the house of representativs, and notwithstanding
the upper house refused to concur in the measure,
it was sent to Congress.</p>

<p>During this situation of affairs, the public odium
against the officers, was augmented by another circumstance.
The officers, just before the disbanding of the
army, had formed a society, called by the name of the
<i>Cincinnati</i>, after the Roman Dictator, Cincinnatus,
which, it was said, was intended to perpetuate the memory
of the revolution, the friendship of the officers, and
the union of the States; and also to raise a fund for
the relief of poor widows and orphans, whose husbands
and fathers had fallen during the war, and for their
<span class="pb" id="Pg186">[pg 186]</span>
descendants. The society was divided into State societies,
which were to meet on the 4th of July, and
with other business, depute a number of their members
to convene annually in general meeting. The members
of the institution were to be distinguished by wearing
a medal, emblematical of the design of the society,
and the honors and advantages were to be hereditary
in the eldest male heirs, and in default of male issue, in
the collateral male heirs. Honorary members were to
be admitted, but without the hereditary advantages of
the society, and provided their number would never
exceed the ratio of one to four of the officers or their
descendants.</p>

<p>Whatever were the real views of the framers of this
institution, its design was generally understood to be
harmless and honorable. The ostensible views of the
society could not however skreen it from popular jealousy.
A spirited pamphlet appeared in South Carolina,
the avowed production of Mr. Burke, one of the
judges of the supreme court in that State, in which the
author attempted to prove that the principles, on which
the society was formed, would, in process of time,
originate and establish an order of nobility in this country,
which would be repugnant to the genius of our
republican governments, and dangerous to liberty.
This pamphlet appeared in Connecticut, during the
commotions raised by the half pay and commutation
acts, and contributed not a little to spread the flame of
opposition. Nothing could exceed the odium which
prevailed at this time, against the men who had hazarded
their persons and properties in the revolution.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the discontents of the people were
general, and ready to burst forth in sedition, yet men
of information, viz. the officers of government, the
clergy, and persons of liberal education, were mostly
opposed to the unconstitutional steps taken by the committees
and convention at Middletown. They supported
the propriety of the measures of Congress, both
by conversation and writing, proved that such grants
to the army were necessary to keep the troops together,
<span class="pb" id="Pg187">[pg 187]</span>
and that the expense would not be enormous nor oppressiv.
During the close of the year 1783, every possible
exertion was made to enlighten the people, and
such was the effect of the arguments used by the minority,
that in the beginning of the following year, the
opposition subsided, the committees were dismissed, and
tranquillity restored to the State. In May, the legislature
were able to carry several measures which had before
been extremely unpopular. An act was passed,
granting the import of five per cent. to Congress; another
giving great encouragement to commerce, and
several towns were incorporated with extensiv privileges,
for the purpose of regulating the exports of the
State, and facilitating the collection of debts.</p>

<p>The opposition to the Congressional acts in favor of
the officers, and to the order of the Cincinnati, did not
rise to the same pitch in the other States as in Connecticut;
yet it produced much disturbance in Massachusetts,
and some others. Jealousy of power had been
universally spread among the people of the United
States. The destruction of the old forms of governments,
and the licentiousness of war had, in a great
measure, broken their habits of obedience; their passions
had been inflamed by the cry of despotism; and
like centinels, who have been suddenly surprised by the
approach of an enemy, the rustling of a leaf was sufficient
to giv them an alarm. This spirit of jealousy,
which has not yet subsided, and which will probably
continue visible during the present generation, operated
with other causes to relax the energy of our federal
operations.</p>

<p>During the war, vast sums of paper currency had
been emitted by Congress, and large quantities of specie
had been introduced, towards the close of the war,
by the French army, and the Spanish trade. This
plenty of money enabled the States to comply with the
first requisitions of Congress; so that during two or
three years, the federal treasury was, in some measure,
supplied. But when the danger of war had ceased, and
the vast importations of foreign goods had lessened the
<span class="pb" id="Pg188">[pg 188]</span>
quantity of circulating specie, the States began to be
very remiss in furnishing their proportion of monies.
The annihilation of the credit of the paper bills had
totally stopped their circulation, and the specie was
leaving the country in cargoes, for remittances to Great
Britain; still the luxurious habits of the people, contracted
during the war, called for new supplies of goods,
and private gratification seconded the narrow policy of
State interest in defeating the operations of the general
government.</p>

<p>Thus the revenues of Congress were annually diminishing;
some of the States wholly neglecting to
make provision for paying the interest of the national
debt; others making but a partial provision, until the
scanty supplies received from a few of the rich States,
would hardly satisfy the demands of the civil list.</p>

<p>This weakness of the federal government, in conjunction
with the flood of certificates or public securities,
which Congress could neither fund nor pay, occasioned
them to depreciate to a very inconsiderable value.
The officers and soldiers of the late army were
obliged to receive for wages these certificates, or promissary
notes, which passed at a fifth, or eighth, or a
tenth of their nominal value; being thus deprived at
once of the greatest part of the reward due for their
services. Some indeed profited by speculations in these
evidences of the public debt; but such as were under
a necessity of parting with them, were robbed of that
support which they had a right to expect and demand
from their countrymen.</p>

<p>Pensylvania indeed made provision for paying the interest
of her debts, both State and federal; assuming
her supposed proportion of the continental debt, and
giving the creditors her own State notes in exchange
for those of the United States. The resources of that
State are immense, but she has not been able to make
punctual payments, even in a depreciated paper currency.</p>

<p>Massachusetts, in her zeal to comply fully with the
requisitions of Congress, and satisfy the demands of
<span class="pb" id="Pg189">[pg 189]</span>
her own creditors, laid a heavy tax upon the people.
This was the immediate cause of the rebellion in that
State, in 1786. But a heavy debt lying on the State,
added to burdens of the same nature, upon almost
every incorporation within it; a decline, or rather an
extinction of public credit; a relaxation and corruption
of manners, and a free use of foreign luxuries; a decay
of trade and manufactures, with a prevailing scarcity of
money; and, above all, individuals involved in debt to
each other: These were the real, though more remote
causes of the insurrection. It was the tax which the people
were required to pay, that caused them to feel evils
which we have enumerated: This called forth all their
other grievances; and the first act of violence committed,
was the burning or destroying of a tax bill. This
sedition threw the State into a convulsion which lasted
about a year; courts of justice were violently obstructed;
the collection of debts was suspended; and a body
of armed troops, under the command of General Lincoln,
was employed during the winter of 1786, to disperse
the insurgents. Yet so numerous were the latter
in the counties of Worcester, Hampshire and Berkshire,
and so obstinately combined to oppose the execution
of law by force, that the Governor and Council
of the State thought proper not to intrust General Lincoln
with military powers, except to act on the defensiv,
and to repel force with force, in case the insurgents
should attack him. The leaders of the rebels however
were not men of talents; they were desperate, but
without fortitude; and while they were supported with
a superior force, they appeared to be impressed with
that consciousness of guilt, which awes the most daring
wretch, and makes him shrink from his purpose. This
appears by the conduct of a large party of the rebels
before the magazine at Springfield; where General
Shepard with a small guard, was stationed to protect
the continental stores. The insurgents appeared upon
the plain, with a vast superiority of numbers, but a few
shot from the artillery made the multitude retreat in
disorder, with the loss of four men. This spirited conduct
<span class="pb" id="Pg190">[pg 190]</span>
of General Shepard, with the industry, perseverance
and prudent firmness of General Lincoln, dispersed
the rebels, drove the leaders from the State, and
restored tranquillity. An act of indemnity was passed
in the Legislature for all the insurgents, except a few
leaders, on condition they should become peaceable
subjects, and take the oath of allegiance. The leaders
afterwards petitioned for pardon, which, from motivs
of policy, was granted by the Legislature.</p>

<p>But the loss of public credit, popular disturbances,
and insurrections, were not the only evils which were
generated by the peculiar circumstances of the times.
The emissions of bills of credit and tender laws, were
added to the black catalogue of political disorders.</p>

<p>The expedient of supplying the deficiencies of specie,
by emissions of paper bills, was adopted very early
in the colonies. The expedient was obvious and produced
good effects. In a new country, where population
is rapid, and the value of lands increasing, the
farmer finds an advantage in paying legal interest for
money; for if he can pay the interest by his profits,
the increasing value of his lands will, in a few years,
discharge the principal.</p>

<p>In no colony was this advantage more sensibly experienced
than in Pensylvania. The emigrants to
that province were numerous; the natural population
rapid; and these circumstances combined, advanced
the value of real property to an astonishing degree. As
the first settlers there, as well as in other provinces,
were poor, the purchase of a few foreign articles drained
them of specie. Indeed for many years, the balance
of trade must have necessarily been greatly against the
colonies.</p>

<p>But bills of credit, emitted by the State and loaned
to the industrious inhabitants, supplied the want of
specie, and enabled the farmer to purchase stock.
These bills were generally a legal tender in all colonial
or private contracts, and the sums issued did not generally
exceed the quantity requisit for a medium of trade;
they retained their full nominal value in the purchase
<span class="pb" id="Pg191">[pg 191]</span>
of commodities. But as they were not received by the
British merchants, in payment for goods, there was a
great demand for specie and bills, which occasioned the
latter at various times to appreciate. Thus was introduced
a difference between the English sterling money
and the currencies of the colonies which remains to
this day.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" title="A dollar, in sterling money, is 4s6. But the price of a dollar rose in New England currency to 6s; in New York to 8s; in New Jersey, Pensylvania and Maryland to 7s6; in Virginia to 6s; in North Carolina to 8s; in South Carolina and Georgia to 4s8. This difference, originating between paper and specie, or bills, continued afterwards to exist in the nominal estimation of gold and silver. Franklin's Miscel. Works, p. 217." class="fnanchor">[47]</a> </p>

<p>The advantages the colonies had derived from bills
of credit, under the British government, suggested to
Congress, in 1775, the idea of issuing bills for the purpose
of carrying on the war. And this was perhaps
their only expedient. Money could not be raised by
taxation; it could not be borrowed. The first emissions
had no other effect upon the medium of commerce,
than to drive the specie from circulation. But
when the paper substituted for specie, had, by repeated
millions, augmented the sum in circulation, much
beyond the usual sum of specie, the bills began to lose
their value. The depreciation continued in proportion
to the sums emitted, until seventy, and even one hundred
and fifty nominal paper dollars, were hardly an
equivalent for one Spanish milled dollar. Still from
the year 1775 to 1781, this depreciating paper currency
was almost the only medium of trade. It supplied the
place of specie, and enabled Congress to support a numerous
army; until the sum in circulation amounted
to two hundred millions of dollars. But about the
year 1780, specie began to be plentiful, being introduced
by the French army, a private trade with the Spanish
islands, and an illicit intercourse with the British
garrison at New York. This circumstance accelerated
the depreciation of the paper bills, until their value had
sunk almost to nothing. In 1781, the merchants and
<span class="pb" id="Pg192">[pg 192]</span>
brokers in the southern States, apprehensiv of the approaching
fate of the currency, pushed immense quantities
of it suddenly into New England, made vast purchases
of goods in Boston, and instantly the bills vanished
from circulation.</p>

<p>The whole history of this continental paper is a history
of public and private frauds. Old specie debts
were often paid in a depreciated currency, and even
new contracts for a few weeks or days were often discharged
with a small part of the value received. From
this plenty and fluctuating state of the medium, sprung
hosts of speculators and itinerant traders, who left their
honest occupations for the prospect of immense gains,
in a fraudulent business, that depended on no fixed
principles, and the profits of which could be reduced to
no certain calculations.</p>

<p>To increase these evils, a project was formed to fix the
prices of articles, and restrain persons from giving or
receiving more for any commodity than the price stated
by authority. These regulating acts were reprobated
by every man acquainted with commerce and finance;
as they were intended to prevent an effect without removing
the cause. To attempt to fix the value of
money, while streams of bills were incessantly flowing
from the treasury of the United States, was as ridiculous
as an attempt to restrain the rising of water in rivers
amidst showers of rain.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all opposition, some States framed
and attempted to enforce these regulating acts. The
effect was, a momentary apparent stand in the price of
articles; innumerable acts of collusion and evasion among
the dishonest; numberless injuries done to the
honest; and finally a total disregard of all such regulations,
and the consequential contempt of laws and
the authority of the magistrate.</p>

<p>During these fluctuations of business, occasioned by
the variable value of money, people lost sight, in some
measure, of the steady principles which had before governed
their intercourse with each other. Speculations
followed and relaxed the rigor of commercial obligations.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg193">[pg 193]</span>
Industry likewise had suffered by the flood of money
which had deluged the States. The prices of produce
had risen in proportion to the quantity of money in
circulation, and the demand for the commodities of the
country. This made the acquisition of money easy,
and indolence and luxury, with their train of desolating
consequences, spread themselves among all descriptions
of people.</p>

<p>But as soon as hostilities between Great Britain and
America were suspended, the scene was changed. The
bills emitted by Congress had long before ceased to circulate;
and the specie of the country was soon drained
off to pay for foreign goods, the importations of which
exceeded all calculation. Within two years from the
close of the war, <i>a scarcity of money</i> was the general cry.
The merchants found it impossible to collect their
debts, and make punctual remittances to their creditors
in Great Britain; and the consumers were driven to
the necessity of retrenching their superfluities in living
and of returning to their ancient habits of industry and
economy.</p>

<p>This change was however progressiv and slow. In
many of the States which suffered by the numerous
debts they had contracted, and by the distresses of war,
the people called aloud for emissions of paper bills to
supply the deficiency of a medium. The depreciation
of the continental bills, was a recent example of the
ill effects of such an expedient, and the impossibility of
supporting the credit of paper, was urged by the opposers
of the measure as a substantial argument against
adopting it. But nothing would silence the popular
clamor; and many men of the first talents and eminence,
united their voices with that of the populace.
Paper money had formerly maintained its credit, and
been of singular utility; and past experience, notwithstanding
a change of circumstances, was an argument
in its favor that bore down all opposition.</p>

<p>Pensylvania, although one of the richest States in
the union, was the first to emit bills of credit, as a substitute
for specie. But the revolution had removed the
<span class="pb" id="Pg194">[pg 194]</span>
necessity of it, at the same time that it had destroyed
the means by which its former credit had been supported.
Lands, at the close of the war, were not rising in
value; bills on London could not so readily be purchased,
as while the province was dependent on Great
Britain; the State was split into parties, one of which
attempted to defeat the measures most popular with the
other; and the depreciation of continental bills, with
the injuries which it had done to individuals, inspired a
general distrust of all public promises.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding a part of the money was loaned on
good landed security, and the faith of that wealthy State
pledged for the redemption of the whole at its nominal
value, yet the advantages of specie as a medium of
commerce, especially as an article of remittance to
London, soon made a difference of ten per cent. between
the bills of credit and specie. This difference
may be considered rather as an appreciation of gold and
silver, than a depreciation of paper; but its effects, in
a commercial State, must be highly prejudicial. It
opens the door to frauds of all kinds, and frauds are
usually practised on the honest and unsuspecting, especially
upon all classes of laborers.</p>

<p>This currency of Pensylvania is receivable in all payments
at the custom house, and for certain taxes, at its
nominal value; yet it has sunk to two thirds of this
value, in the few commercial transactions where it is
received.</p>

<p>North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, had
recourse to the same wretched expedient to supply
themselves with money; not reflecting that industry,
frugality, and good commercial laws are the only means
of turning the balance of trade in favor of a country,
and that this balance is the only permanent source of
solid wealth and ready money. But the bills they
emitted shared a worse fate than those of Pensylvania;
they expelled almost all the circulating cash from the
States; they lost a great part of their nominal value;
they impoverished the merchants, and embarrassed the
planters.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg195">[pg 195]</span>
The State of Virginia had too much wisdom to emit
bills; but tolerated a practice among the inhabitants of
cutting dollars and smaller pieces of silver, in order to
prevent it from leaving the State. This pernicious
practice prevailed also in Georgia.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" title="A dollar was usually cut in five pieces, and each passed by toll for a quarter; so that the man who cut it gained a quarter, or rather a fifth. If the State should recoin this silver, it must lose a fifth." class="fnanchor">[48]</a> </p>

<p>Maryland escaped the calamity of a paper currency.
The house of delegates brought forward a bill for the
emission of bills of credit to a large amount; but the
senate firmly and successfully resisted the pernicious
scheme. The opposition between the two houses was
violent and tumultuous; it threatened the State with
anarchy; but the question was carried to the people,
and the good sense of the senate finally prevailed.</p>

<p>New Jersey is situated between two or the largest
commercial towns in America, and consequently
drained of specie. This State also emitted a large sum
in bills of credit, which served to pay the interest of the
public debt; but the currency depreciated, as in other
States.</p>

<p>Rhode Island exhibits a melancholy proof of that
licentiousness and anarchy which always follows a relaxation
of the moral principles. In a rage for supplying
the State with money, and filling every man's
pocket without obliging him to earn it by his diligence,
the Legislature passed an act for making one hundred
thousand pounds in bills; a sum much more than sufficient
for a medium of trade in that State, even without
any specie. The merchants in Newport and
Providence opposed the act with firmness; their opposition
added fresh vigour to the resolution of the assembly,
and induced them to inforce the scheme by a legal
lender of a most extraordinary nature. They passed
an act, ordaining that if any creditor should refuse to
take their bills, for any debt whatever, the debtor might
lodge the sum due, with a justice of the peace, who
<span class="pb" id="Pg196">[pg 196]</span>
should giv notice of it in the public papers; and if the
creditor did not appear and receive the money within
six months from the first notice, his debt should be forfeited.
This act astonished all honest men, and even
the promoters of paper money making in other States,
and on other principles, reprobated this act of Rhode
Island, as wicked and oppressiv. But the State was
governed by faction. During the cry for paper money,
a number of boisterous ignorant men, were elected into
the Legislature, from the smaller towns in the State.
Finding themselves united with a majority in opinion,
they formed and executed any plan their inclination
suggested; they opposed every measure that was agreeable
to the mercantile interest; they not only made bad
laws to suit their own wicked purposes, but appointed
their own corrupt creatures to fill the judicial and executiv
departments. Their money depreciated sufficiently
to answer all their vile purposes in the discharge
of debts; business almost totally ceased; all confidence
was lost; the State was thrown into confusion at home,
and was execrated abroad.</p>

<p>Massachusetts Bay had the good fortune, amidst her
political calamities, to prevent an emission of bills of
credit. New Hampshire made no paper; but in the
distresses which followed her loss of business after the
war, the Legislature made horses, lumber, and most articles
of produce a legal tender in the fulfilment of
contracts. It is doubtless unjust to oblige a creditor to
receive any thing for his debt, which he had not in contemplation
at the time of the contract. But as the
commodities which were to be a tender by the law of
New Hampshire, were of an <ins class="corr" title="intrisic" id="C196">intrinsic</ins> value, bearing
some proportion to the amount of the debt, the injustice
of the law was less flagrant, than that which enforced
the tender of paper in Rhode Island. Indeed a
similar law prevailed for some time in Massachusetts;
and in Connecticut it is optional with the creditor, either
to imprison the debtor, or take land on an execution,
at a price to be fixed by three indifferent freeholders;
provided no other means of payment shall appear
<span class="pb" id="Pg197">[pg 197]</span>
to satisfy the demand. It must not however be omitted,
that while the most flourishing commercial States
introduced a paper medium, to the great injury of honest
men, a bill for an emission of paper in Connecticut,
where there is very little specie, could never command
more than one eighth of the votes of the Legislature.
The movers of the bill have hardly escaped ridicule;
so generally is the measure reprobated as a source of
fraud and public mischief.</p>

<p>The Legislature of New York, a State that had the
least necessity and apology for making paper money, as
her commercial advantages always furnish her with
specie sufficient for a medium, issued a large sum in
bills of credit, which support their value better than the
currency of any other State. Still the paper has raised
the value of specie, which is always in demand for exportation,
and this difference of exchange between paper
and specie, exposes commerce to most of the inconveniencies
resulting from a depreciated medium.</p>

<p>Such is the history of paper money thus far; a miserable
substitute for real coin, in a country where the
reins of government are too weak to compel the fulfilment
of public engagements; and where all confidence
in public faith is totally destroyed.</p>

<p>While the States were thus endeavoring to repair the
loss of specie, by empty promises, and to support their
business by shadows, rather than by reality, the British
ministry formed some commercial regulations that deprived
them of the profits of their trade to the West
Indies and to Great Britain. Heavy duties were laid
upon such articles as were remitted to the London
merchants for their goods, and such were the duties upon
American bottoms, that the States were almost
wholly deprived of the carrying trade. A prohibition
was laid upon the produce of the United States, shipped
to the English West India Islands in American
built vessels, and in those manned by American seamen.
These restrictions fell heavy upon the eastern
States, which depended much upon ship building for
<span class="pb" id="Pg198">[pg 198]</span>
the support of their trade; and they materially injured
the business of the other States.</p>

<p>Without a union that was able to form and execute
a general system of commercial regulations, some of
the States attempted to impose restraints upon the British
trade that should indemnify the merchant for the
losses he had suffered, or induce the British ministry to
enter into a commercial treaty, and relax the rigor of
their navigation laws. These measures however produced
nothing but mischief. The States did not act
in concert, and the restraints laid on the trade of one
State operated to throw the business into the hands of
its neighbor. Massachusetts, in her zeal to counteract
the effect of the English navigation laws, laid enormous
duties upon British goods imported into that State;
but the other States did not adopt a similar measure;
and the loss of business soon obliged that State to repeal
or suspend the law. Thus when Pensylvania laid
heavy duties on British goods, Delaware and New Jersey
made a number of free ports to encourage the landing
of goods within the limits of those States; and the
duties in Pensylvania served no purpose, but to create
smuggling.</p>

<p>Thus divided, the States began to feel their weakness.
Most of the Legislatures had neglected to comply
with the requisitions of Congress for furnishing the
federal treasury; the resolves of Congress were disregarded;
the proposition for a general import to be laid
and collected by Congress was negatived first by Rhode
Island, and afterwards by New York. The British
troops continued, under pretence of a breach of treaty
on the part of America, to hold possession of the forts
on the frontiers of the States, and thus commanded
the fur trade. Many of the States individually were
infested with popular commotions or iniquitous tender
laws, while they were oppressed with public debts; the
certificates or public notes had lost most of their value,
and circulated merely as the objects of speculation;
Congress lost their respectability, and the United States
their credit and importance.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg199">[pg 199]</span>
In the midst of these calamities, a proposition was
made in 1785, in the house of delegates, in Virginia,
to appoint commissioners, to meet such as might be
appointed in the other States, who should form a system
of commercial regulations for the United States,
and recommend it to the several Legislatures for adoption.
Commissioners were accordingly appointed and
a request was made to the Legislatures of the other
States to accede to the proposition. Accordingly several
of the States appointed commissioners, who met at
Annapolis in the summer of 1786, to consult what
measures should be taken to unite the States in some
general and efficient commercial system. But as the
States were not all represented, and the powers of the
commissioners were, in their opinion, too limited to propose
a system of regulations adequate to the purposes of
government, they agreed to recommend a general convention
to be held at Philadelphia the next year, with
powers to frame a general plan of government for the
United States. This measure appeared to the commissioners
absolutely necessary. The old confederation
was essentially defectiv. It was destitute of almost every
principle necessary to giv effect to legislation.</p>

<p>It was defectiv in the article of legislating over States,
instead of individuals. All history testifies that recommendations
will not operate as laws, and compulsion
cannot be exercised over States, without violence, war
and anarchy. The confederation was also destitute of
a sanction to its laws. When resolutions were passed
in Congress, there was no power to compel obedience
by fine, by suspension of privileges or other means. It
was also destitute of a guarantee for the State governments.
Had one State been invaded by its neighbor,
the union was not constitutionally bound to assist in repelling
the invasion, and supporting the constitution of
the invaded State. The confederation was further
deficient in the principle of apportioning the quotas of
money to be furnished by each State; in a want of
power to form commercial laws, and to raise troops for
the defence and security of the union; in the equal
<span class="pb" id="Pg200">[pg 200]</span>
suffrage of the States, which placed Rhode Island on a
footing in Congress with Virginia; and to crown all
the defects, we may add the want of a judiciary power,
to define the laws of the union, and to reconcile the
contradictory decisions of a number of independent
judicatories.</p>

<p>These and many inferior defects were obvious to
the commissioners, and therefore they urged a general
convention, with powers to form and offer to the consideration
of the States, a system of general government
that should be less exceptionable. Accordingly in
May, 1787, delegates from all the States, except Rhode
Island, assembled at Philadelphia; and chose General
Washington for their president. After four months
deliberation, in which the clashing interests of the several
States, appeared in all their force, the convention
agreed to recommend a plan of federal government, &amp;c.</p>

<p>As soon as the plan of the federal constitution was
submitted to the Legislatures of the several States, they
proceeded to take measures for collecting the sense of
the people upon the propriety of adopting it. In the
small State of Delaware, a convention was called in
November, which, after a few days deliberation, ratified
the constitution, without a dissenting voice.</p>

<p>In the convention of Pensylvania, held the same
month, there was a spirited opposition to the new form
of government. The debates were long and interesting.
Great abilities and firmness were displayed on
both sides; but, on the 13th of December, the constitution
was received by two thirds of the members.
The minority were dissatisfied, and with an obstinacy
that ill became the representativs of a free people, published
their reasons of dissent, which were calculated to
inflame a party already violent, and which, in fact, produced
some disturbances in the western parts of the
State. But the opposition has since subsided.</p>

<p>In New Jersey, the convention which met in December,
were unanimous in adopting the constitution;
as was likewise that of Georgia.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg201">[pg 201]</span>
In Connecticut there was some opposition; but the
constitution was, on the 9th of January, 1788, ratified
by three fourths of the votes in convention, and the
minority peaceably acquiesced in the decision.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts, the opposition was large and respectable.
The convention, consisting of more than
three hundred delegates, were assembled in January,
and continued their debates, with great candor and
liberality, about five weeks. At length the question
was carried for the constitution by a small majority,
and the minority, with that manly condescension
which becomes great minds, submitted to the measure,
and united to support the government.</p>

<p>In New Hampshire, the federal cause was, for some
time doubtful. The greatest number of the delegates
in convention, were at first on the side of the opposition;
and some, who might have had their objections
removed by the discussion of the subject, instructed to
reject the constitution. Altho the instructions of constituents
cannot, on the true principles of representation,
be binding upon a deputy, in any legislativ assembly,
because his constituents are but a <i>part</i> of the
State, and have not heard the arguments and objections
of the <i>whole</i>; whereas, his act is to affect the
<i>whole</i> State, and therefore is to be directed by the sense
or wisdom of the whole, collected in the legislativ assembly;
yet the delegates in the New Hampshire convention
conceived, very erroneously, that the sense of
the freemen in the towns, those little districts, where
no act of legislation can be performed, imposed a restraint
upon their own wills.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" title="This pernicious opinion has prevailed in all the States, and done infinit mischief." class="fnanchor">[49]</a> An adjournment was
therefore moved, and carried. This gave the people
opportunity to gain a farther knowlege of the merits
of the constitution, and at the second meeting of the
convention, it was ratified by a respectable majority.</p>

<p>In Maryland, several men of abilities appeared in the
opposition, and were unremitted in their endeavors to
persuade the people, that the proposed plan of government
<span class="pb" id="Pg202">[pg 202]</span>
was artfully calculated to deprive them of their
dearest rights; yet in convention it appeared that five
sixths of the voices were in favor of it.</p>

<p>In South Carolina, the opposition was respectable;
but two thirds of the convention appeared to advocate
and vote for the constitution.</p>

<p>In Virginia, many of the principal characters opposed
the ratification of the constitution with great abilities
and industry. But after a full discussion of the
subject, a small majority, of a numerous convention,
appeared for its adoption.</p>

<p>In New York, two thirds of the delegates in convention
were, at their first meeting, determined to reject
the constitution. Here, therefore, the debates
were the most interesting, and the event extremely
doubtful. The argument was managed with uncommon
address and abilities on both sides of the question.
But during the session, the ninth and tenth States had
acceded to the proposed plan, so that by the constitution,
Congress were empowered to issue an ordinance
for organizing the new government. This event
placed the opposition on new ground; and the expediency
of uniting with the other States; the generous
motivs of conciliating all differences, and the danger of
a rejection, influenced a respectable number, who were
originally opposed to the constitution, to join the federal
interest. The constitution was accordingly ratified
by a small majority; but the ratification was accompanied
here, as in Virginia, with a bill of rights,
declaratory of the sense of the convention, as to certain
great principles, and with a catalogue of amendments,
which were to be recommended to the consideration of
the new Congress, and the several State Legislatures.</p>

<p>North Carolina met in convention in July, to deliberate
on the new constitution. After a short session
they rejected it, by a majority of one hundred and seventy
six, against seventy six.</p>

<p>Rhode Island was doomed to be the sport of a blind
and singular policy. The Legislature, in consistency
with the measures which had been before pursued, did
<span class="pb" id="Pg203">[pg 203]</span>
not call a convention, to collect the sense of the State
upon the proposed constitution; but in an unconstitutional
and absurd manner, submitted the plan of government
to the consideration of the people. Accordingly
it was brought before town meetings, and in most
of them rejected. In some of the large towns, particularly
in Newport and Providence, the people collected
and resolved, with great propriety, that they could not
take up the subject; and that the proposition for embracing
or rejecting the federal constitution, could come
before no tribunal but that of the <i>State</i> in convention
or legislature.</p>

<p>From the moment the proceedings of the general
convention at Philadelphia transpired, the public mind
was exceedingly agitated, and suspended between hope
and fear, until nine States had ratified the plan of a
federal government. Indeed, the anxiety continued
until Virginia and New York had acceded to the system.
But this did not prevent the demonstrations of
joy, on the accession of each State.</p>

<p>On the ratification in Massachusetts, the citizens of
Boston, in the elevation of their joy, formed a procession
in honor of the happy event, which was novel,
splendid and magnificent. This example was afterwards
followed, and in some instances improved upon,
in Baltimore, Charleston, Philadelphia, New Haven,
Portsmouth and New York, successivly. Nothing
could equal the beauty and grandeur of these exhibitions.
A ship was mounted upon wheels, and drawn
thro the streets; mechanics erected stages, and exhibited
specimens of labor in their several occupations, as
they moved along the road; flags with emblems, descriptiv
of all the arts and of the federal union, were
invented and displayed in honor of the government;
multitudes of all ranks in life assembled to view the
majestic scenes; while sobriety, joy and harmony
marked the brilliant exhibitions, by which the Americans
celebrated the establishment of their empire.</p>

<p>In March, 1789, the delegates from the eleven ratifying
States, convened in New York, where convenient
<span class="pb" id="Pg204">[pg 204]</span>
and elegant accommodations had been furnished by the
citizens. On opening the ballots for President, it appeared
that the late Commander in Chief of our armies
was unanimously elected to the dignified office.
This event diffused universal joy among the friends to
the union.</p>

<p>The deliberations of the first American Legislature
were marked with wisdom, spirit, and generally with
candor. The establishment of a revenue and judiciary
system, with other national measures; the wise appointments
to offices; the promptness and energy of
the executiv, with a growing popular attachment to
the general government, open the fairest prospect of
peace, union and prosperity to these States; a prospect
that is brightened by the accession of North Carolina
to the government in November, 1789.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>I had embraced the idea, that the remarkable
fortifications on the Muskingum, might be justly ascribed
to the Spaniards, under Ferdinand de Soto, who penetrated
into Florida, about the year 1540; which opinion I endeavored

three or four letters on the subject, to Dr. Stiles, which
were published in 1789. It is now very clear that my

<i>Those letters, therefore, are not worth republishing; but the
following extract, on a different subject, may be considered as

<p>But how shall we account for the mounts, caves,
graves, &amp;c. and for the contents, which evince the
existence of the custom of burning the dead or their
bones; can these be ascribed to the Spaniards? I presume,
Sir, you will be of opinion they cannot. Capt.
Heart says,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" title="Columbian Magazine for May, 1787." class="fnanchor">[50]</a> these graves are small mounts of earth,
from some of which human bones have been taken; in
one were found bones in the natural position of a man,
buried nearly east and west, and a quantity of ising glass
on his breast; in the other graves, the bones were irregular,
some calcined by fire, others burnt only to a
<span class="pb" id="Pg206">[pg 206]</span>
certain degree, so as to render them more durable; in
others the mouldered bones retain their shape, without
any substance; others are partly rotten and partly the
remains of decayed bones; in most of the graves were
found stones evidently burnt, pieces of charcoal, Indian
arrows and pieces of earthen ware, which appeared to
be a composition of shells and cement.</p>

<p>That these mounts and graves are the works of the
nativ Indians, is very evident, for such small mounts
are scattered over every part of North America. "It
was customary with the Indians of the West Jersey,"
says Mr. Smith, page 137, "when they buried the
dead, to put family utensils, bows and arrows, and
sometimes wampum into the grave, as tokens of their
affection. When a person of note died far from the
place of his own residence, they would carry his bones
to be buried there. They washed and perfumed the
dead, painted the face, and followed singly; left the
dead in a fitting posture, and covered the grave pyramidically.
They were very curious in preserving and
repairing the graves of their dead, and pensivly visited
them."</p>

<p>It is said by the English, who are best acquainted
with the manners of the nativs, that they had a custom
of collecting, at certain stated periods, all the bones of
their deceased friends, and burying them in some common
grave. Over these cemetaries or general repositories
of the dead, were erected those vast heaps of
earth or mounts, similar to those which are called in
England <i>barrows</i>, and which are discovered in every
part of the United States.</p>

<p>The Indians seem to have had two methods of burying
the dead; one was, to deposit one body (or at most
but a small number of bodies) in a place, and cover it
with stones, thrown together in a careless manner.
The pile thus formed would naturally be nearly circular,
but those piles that are discovered are something
oval. In the neighborhood of my father's house, about
seven miles from Hartford, on the public road to
Farmington, there is one of those <i>Carrnedds</i> or heaps of
<span class="pb" id="Pg207">[pg 207]</span>
stone. I often passed by it in the early part of my
youth, but never measured its circumference or examined
its contents. My present opinion is, that its circumference
is about twenty five feet. The inhabitants
in the neighborhood report, as a tradition received
from the nativs, that an Indian was buried there, and
that it is the custom for every Indian that passes by to
cast a stone upon the heap. This custom I have never
seen practised, but have no doubt of its existence; as it
is confirmed by the general testimony of the first American
settlers.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" title="The existence of a custom of paying respect to these Indian heaps, as they are called, is proved by a ludicrous practice, that prevails among the Anglo Americans in the vicinity, of making strangers pull off their hats as they pass by this grave. A man passing by with one who is a stranger to the custom, never fails to practise a jest upon him, by telling him that a spider, a caterpillar, or some other insect is upon his hat;..." class="fnanchor">[51]</a> </p>

<p>The other mode of burying the dead, was to deposit
a vast number of bodies, or the bones which were taken
from the single scattered graves, in a common cemetary,
and over them raise vast <i>tumuli</i> or barrows, such
as the mount at Muskingum, which is 390 feet in circumference,
and 50 feet high. The best account of
these cemetaries may be found in Mr. Jefferson's Notes
on Virginia, which will appear the most satisfactory to
the reader in his own words.</p>

<p>"I know of no such thing existing as an Indian monument,
for I would not honor with that name, arrow
points, stone hatchets, stone pipes, and half shapen images.
Of labor on the large scale, I think there are no
remains as respectable as would be a common ditch for
the draining of lands, unless it be the barrows, of which
<span class="pb" id="Pg208">[pg 208]</span>
many are to be found all over this country. These
are of different sizes, some of them constructed of earth,
and some of loose stones. That they were repositories
of the dead has been obvious to all; but on what particular
occasion constructed, was matter of doubt. Some
have thought they covered the bones of those who have
fallen in battles, fought on the spot of interment.
Some ascribe them to the custom, said to prevail among
the Indians, of collecting at certain periods the bones
of all their dead, wherever deposited at the time of death.
Others again supposed them the general sepulchre for
towns, conjectured to have been on or near these grounds,
and this opinion was supported by the quality of the
lands in which they are found, (those constructed of
earth being generally in the softest and most fertile
meadow grounds on river sides) and by a tradition said
to be handed down from the aboriginal Indians, that
when they settled in a town, the first person who died
was placed erect, and earth put about him so as to cover
and support him; that when another died, a narrow
passage was dug to the first, the second reclined against
him, and the cover of earth replaced, and so on. There
being one of these in my neighborhood, I wished to
satisfy myself whether any, and which of these opinions
were just; for this purpose I determined to open and
examin it thoroughly. It was situated on the low
grounds of the Rivanna, about two miles above its
principal fork, and opposit to some hills on which had
been an Indian town. It was of a spheroidical form,
of about forty feet diameter at the base, and had been
of about twelve feet altitude, tho now reduced by the
plow to seven and a half; having been under cultivation
about a dozen years.</p>

<p>"Before this, it was covered with trees of twelve
inches diameter, and round the base was an excavation
of five feet depth and width, from whence the earth
had been taken, of which the hillock was formed. I
first dug superficially in several parts of it, and came to
collections of human bones at different depths, from
six inches to three feet, below the surface. These were
<span class="pb" id="Pg209">[pg 209]</span>
lying in the utmost confusion; some vertical, some oblique,
some horizontal, and directed to every point of
the compass, entangled and held together in clusters by
the earth. Bones of the most distant parts were found
together; as for instance, the small bones of the foot
in the hollow of a scull; many sculls were sometimes
in contact, lying on the face, on the side, on the back,
top or bottom, so as on the whole, to giv the idea of
bones emptied promiscuously from a bag or basket,
and covered over with earth, without any attention to
their order. The bones, of which the greatest numbers
remained, were sculls, jaw bones, teeth, the bones
of the arms, thighs, legs, feet and hands. A few ribs
remained, some vertibrÃ¦ of the neck and spine, without
their processes, and one instance only of the bone
which serves as the base to the vertebral column (the
os sacrum)."</p>

<p>After making some remarks on the state of putrefaction
in which the bones appeared, and on the discovery
of the bones of infants, Mr. Jefferson goes on,
"I proceeded then to make a perpendicular cut thro
the body of the barrow, that I might examin its internal
structure. This passed about three feet from its
center, was opened to the former surface of earth, and
was wide enough for a man to walk thro and examin
its sides.</p>

<p>"At the bottom, that is on the level of the circumjacent
plain, I found bones; above these a few stones
brought from a cliff, a quarter of a mile off, and from
the river one eighth of a mile off. Then a large interval
of earth, then a stratum of bones, and so on. At
one end of the section, were four strata of bones plainly
distinguishable; at the other, three; the strata in one
part not ranging with those in another. The bones
nearest the surface were least decayed. No holes were
discovered in any of them, as if made with bullets, arrows
or other weapons. I conjectured that in this
barrow might have been a thousand skeletons. Every
one will readily seize the circumstances above related,
which militate against the opinion, that it covered the
<span class="pb" id="Pg210">[pg 210]</span>
bones only of persons fallen in battle; and against the
tradition also which would make it the common sepulchre
of a town, in which the bodies were placed upright,
and touching each other. Appearances certainly
indicate, that it has derived both origin and growth
from the accustomary collection of bones and deposition
of them together; that the first collection had
been deposited on the common surface of the earth,
that a few stones were put over it, and then a covering
of earth, that the second had been laid on this, had
covered more or less of it in proportion to the number
of bones, and was then also covered with earth, and so
on. The following are the particular circumstances,
which giv it this aspect. 1 The number of bones. 2
The strata in one part having no correspondence with
those in another. 3 The different states of decay in
these strata, which seem to indicate a difference in the
time of inhumation. 4 The existence of infant bones
among them.</p>

<p>"But on whatever occasion they may have been made,
they are of considerable notoriety among the Indians;
for a party passing about thirty years ago, thro the part
of the country where this barrow is, went thro the
woods directly to it, without any instructions or inquiry,
and having staid about it some time, with expressions
which were construed to be those of sorrow,
they returned to the high road which they had left about
half a dozen miles, to pay this visit, and pursued
their journey. There is another barrow, much resembling
this, in the low grounds of the south branch of
the Shenandoah, where it is crossed by the road leading
from the Rockfish Gap to Staunton. Both of these
have within these dozen years, been cleared of their
trees and put under cultivation, are much reduced in
their height, and spread in width, by the plow, and will
probably disappear in time. There is another on a
hill in the blue ridge of mountains, a few miles north
of Wood's Gap, which is made up of small stones
thrown together. This has been opened, and found
<span class="pb" id="Pg211">[pg 211]</span>
to contain human bones, as the others do. There are
also others in other parts of the country."</p>

<p>From this account of Mr. Jefferson, to whose industry
and talents the sciences and his country will ever
be indebted, we may fairly conclude that the mounts
at Muskingum are the work of the nativ Indians. It
is however necessary to notice two or three particulars,
in the appearance of those at Muskingum, which are
not discovered (or not mentioned by Mr. Jefferson) in
the structure of that which he examined. These are
the ising glass, the earthen ware, the charcoal, and the
calcination of the bones by fire. As to the first it is
well known that the ising glass is found only in particular
parts of America, and the savages in other parts
could not obtain it. Mr. Jefferson mentions no discovery
of earthen ware, but it was used by the Indians
in every part of America. The piece you once shewed
me, sir, is a specimen of what is found wherever there
has been an Indian town. Pieces of it are dug up frequently
in the meadows on Connecticut river. It appears
to be formed of pure clay, or of shells and cement,
hardened by fire, and as we might naturally
suppose, without glazing. By sections of vessels which
remain, it is evident they were wrought with great ingenuity,
and into beautiful and convenient forms.</p>

<p>The charcoal and calcination of some bones are a
proof that there has existed, among the savages of America,
a custom of burning the dead, or their bones,
after the dissolution of the flesh. It does not appear
that this custom was general, but it is not at all surprising
to find that such a practice has existed in this
country; since it has been frequent among the uncivilized
nations on the eastern continent.</p>

<p>I am sensible, sir, that you have entertained an opinion
that the story of Madoc, the Welch Prince, may
be true, and that it is possible the fortifications at Muskingum
may be the work of his colony. Of the truth
of this conclusion there is perhaps no direct evidence,
and yet collateral evidence may be obtained, that it is
not chimerical. There is such a surprising affinity between
<span class="pb" id="Pg212">[pg 212]</span>
the Indian mounts and the barrows or cemetaries
which are remaining in England, but particularly in
Wales and Anglesey, the last retreat of the original
Britons, that we can hardly resolve it into a common
principle of analogy that subsists between nations in
the same stage of society; but incredulity itself will acknowlege
the probability, that the primitiv inhabitants
of Britain and America had a common stock from
which they were derived, long since the age of the first
parent: Not that I believe North America to be peopled
so late as the twelfth century, the period of Madoc's
migration, but supposing America to have been
settled two or three thousand years before that period,
a subsequent colony might pass the Atlantic and bring
the Roman improvements in fortification.</p>

<p>Waving further conjectures, I beg leave to describe
the analogy between the barrows in England and
Wales, and in America. This will be striking, and
cannot fail to entertain a curious reader, because it is
attended with positiv proofs.</p>

<p>In England, Scotland, Wales, and the island Anglesey,
there are numbers of monuments erected by
the ancients; but the most remarkable are generally
found in the two latter, whither the old Britons retreated
from their Roman and Saxon conquerors; and
<i>Anglesey</i>, the ancient <i>Mona</i>, is supposed to have been
the chief seat of the Druids. The remains of most
consequence are the <i>cromlechs</i>, the <i>tumuli</i>, and the <i>cumuli</i>
or <i>carrnedds</i>. <i>Cromlech</i>, if the word is derived
from the British roots <i>krom laech</i>, signifies a <i>bending
stone</i>.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" title="Camden's Britannia, volume II, page 759." class="fnanchor">[52]</a> This is the common opinion, as Rowland observes.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" title="Mona Antiq. Restaur, page 47." class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
If we trace the origin to the Hebrew, the
root of the old British,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" title="That the primitiv Britons may claim a very direct descent from the ancient inhabitants of Syria and Phenicia, whose languages were but branches from the same common stock, with as Hebrew, may be made to appear probable by a comparison of their customs; but may be almost demonstrated by a collation of the old British language with the Hebrew roots. See my Dissertations on the English Language, Appendix." class="fnanchor">[54]</a> we shall find it not less significativ;
<span class="pb" id="Pg213">[pg 213]</span>
for <i>cÃ¦rem luach</i> signify <i>devoted stone</i>, or <i>altar</i>.
These <i>cromlechs</i> consist of large stones, pitched on end
in the earth, as supporters, upon which is laid a broad
stone of a vast size. The supporters stand in a bending
posture, and are from three to seven feet high. The
top stone is often found to be of twenty or thirty tons
weight, and remains to this day on the pillars. Numbers
of these are found in Wales and Anglesey; but
none is more remarkable than that in Wiltshire, called
<i>stone henge</i>, for a full description of which I must beg
leave to refer you to Camden's Britannia, vol. I, page
119. These cromlechs are doubtless works of great
antiquity; but for what purpose they were erected, at
such an immense expense of time and labor as would
be necessary to convey stones of thirty tons weight a
considerable distance, and raise them several feet, is not
easily determined. The probability is that they were
altars for sacrifice, as pieces of burnt bones and ashes
are found near them. They might also be used in
other ceremonies, under the druidical system, as the
ratification of covenants, &amp;c. As this kind of monuments
is not found in America, I will wave a further
consideration of it; observing only, that it was an ancient
practice among the eastern nations, to raise heaps
of stones, as witnesses of agreements, and sacrifice upon
them, as a solemn ratification of the act of the parties.
Many instances of this ceremony are mentioned
in the old testament. The covenant between Jacob
and Laban was witnessed by a heap of stones, which
served also as a boundary between their respectiv
claims. "<i>And Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount</i>,
that is, the heap, <i>and called his brethren to eat bread</i>."
Gen. xxxi, 54. A similar custom seems to have prevailed
among the primitiv Britons.</p>

<p>But the <i>tumuli</i>, barrows or mounts of earth, which
remain in multitudes in England and Wales, are constructed
exactly in the manner of the barrows, described
by Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Heart. One of these in
Wiltshire, Camden thus describes.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" title="Britannia, volume I, page 127." class="fnanchor">[55]</a> "Here Selbury,
<span class="pb" id="Pg214">[pg 214]</span>
a round hill, rises to a considerable height, and seems
by the fashion of it, and the sliding down of the earth
about it, to have been cast up by mens hands. Of this
fort there are many in this country, round and copped,
which are called <i>burrows</i> or <i>barrows</i>; perhaps raised in
memory of the soldiers slain there. For <i>bones are
found in them</i>, and I have read, it was a custom among
the northern people, that every soldier who survived a
battle, should bring a helmet full of earth towards the
raising of monuments for their slain fellows."</p>

<p>This is said to be the largest and most uniform barrow
in the country, and perhaps in England; and I
regret that the height and circumference are not mentioned.
I am however informed verbally by a gentleman
who has visited England, that some of these tumuli
appear to have been nearly one hundred feet high.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" title="One as large as that is said to be found at Grave Creek, about eighty miles above Muskingum." class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
There are also in the same country several kinds of barrows
of different sizes; some surrounded with trenches;
others not; some with stones set round them, others
without any; the general figure of them is nearly
circular, but a little oval.</p>

<p>In Penbrokeshire, in Wales, Camden informs us<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" title="Volume II, page 763." class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
"there are divers ancient tumuli, or artificial mounts
for urn burial, whereof the most notable I have seen,
are those four, called <i>krigeu kemaes</i>, or the burrows of
<i>kemeas</i>. One of these a gentlemen of the neighborhood,
out of curiosity, and for the satisfaction of some
friends, caused lately to be dug; and discovered therein
five urns, which contained a considerable quantity of
burnt bones and ashes." If there is any difference between
these barrows, and those at Muskingum, it is
this, that in Wales the bones were lodged in urns;
probably this was the fate of the bodies of eminent men
only, or it proves a greater degree of improvement in
Britain than appears among the American savages.</p>

<p>In Caermardhinshire, there is a barrow of a singular
kind. It is called, <i>krig y dyrn</i> (probably the king's
<span class="pb" id="Pg215">[pg 215]</span>
barrow.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" title="Camden, volume II, page 751." class="fnanchor">[58]</a>) The circumference at bottom is sixty paces,
and its height about six yards. It rises by an easy ascent
to the top, which is hollow. This is a heap of
earth, raised over a <i>carrnedd</i> or pile of stones. In the
center of the cavity on the top, there is a large flat
stone, about nine feet by five; beneath this was found
a <i>kist vaen</i>, a kind of stone chest, four feet and a half by
three, and made up of stones, and within and about it
were found a few pieces of brick and stones. This
might have been the tomb of a druid, or prince.</p>

<p>The <i>cumuli</i> of stones or <i>caernedds</i>, as they are called
by the Welsh, from <i>keren nedh</i>, a <i>coped heap</i>, are scattered
over the west of England and Wales, and appear to
have been raised in the manner of our Indian heaps,
and for the same purpose, viz. to preserve the memory
of the dead. Every Indian in this country that passes
one of these heaps, throws a stone upon it. Rowland
remarks that the same custom exists among the vulgar
Welch to this day; and if I mistake not, Camden
takes notice of the same practice. Rowland says, "in
these <i>coel ceithic</i>, (certain festivals) people use, even to
this day, to throw and offer each one his stone, tho they
know not the reason. The common tradition is, that
these heaps cover the graves of men, signal either for
eminent virtues, or notorious villanies, on which every
person looked on himself obliged as he passed by, to bestow
a stone, in veneration of his good life, or in detestation
of his vileness." This practice now prevails in
Wales and Anglesey, merely as a mark of contempt.</p>

<p>The <i>carrnedds</i> in America answer exactly the description
of those in Wales, and the practice of throwing
upon the heap each man his stone as he passes by,
exists among the Indians, in its purity; that is, as <i>a
mark of respect</i>.</p>

<p>It is said by authors that mounts and piles of stones,
are found likewise in Denmark and Sweden; but in
construction they differ from those found in Britain.
Yet from the foregoing descriptions, taken from authentic
testimony, it appears, that between the barrows
<span class="pb" id="Pg216">[pg 216]</span>
in England and America, the manner of constructing
them in both, and the purposes to which they were applied,
there is an analogy, rarely to be traced in works
of such consequence, among nations whose intercourse
ceased at Babel; an analogy that we could hardly suppose
would exist among nations descended from different
stocks. This analogy however, without better evidence,
will not demonstrate the direct descent of the
Indians from the ancient Celts or Britons. But as all
the primitiv inhabitants of the west of Europe were
evidently of the same stock, it is natural to suppose they
might pass from Norway to Iceland, from Iceland to
Greenland, and from thence to Labrador; and thus
the North American savages may claim a common
origin with the primitiv Britons and Celts. This supposition
has some foundation, and is by no means obviated
by Cook's late discoveries in the Pacific ocean.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" title="Mons. Mallet, in his Northern Antiquities, has produced unquestionable testimony, from the Chronicles of Iceland and others histories of the north, that the American continent was discovered about the tenth century; and the esquimaux are clearly of the same race as the Greenlanders." class="fnanchor">[59]</a> </p>

<p>These are however but conjectures. Future discoveries
may throw more light upon these subjects. At
present, a few facts only can be collected to amuse a
contemplativ mind, and perhaps lead to inquiries which
will result in a satisfactory account of the first peopling
of America, and of the few remains of antiquity which
it affords.</p>

<h2><span class="pb" id="Pg217">[pg 217]</span>No. XVII.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<span class="ralign"><small>NEW YORK, FEBRUARY, 1788.</small></span></p>
<p class="center"><big><i>On the</i> REGULARITY <i>of the</i> <span class="smcap">City</span> <i>of</i>
PHILADELPHIA.</big></p>

<p>"Well, how do you like Boston?" said an
American to a Londoner, who had just arrived,
and walked thro the town. "Extremely," replied
the Englishman; "it resembles London in the
crookedness and narrowness of the streets; I am always
pleased with a careless irregularity and variety."</p>

<p>"How do you like Boston," says a nativ of the town to
a Philadelphian. "I am much pleased with the
people," replies the gentleman; "but the streets are so
crooked, narrow and irregular, that I have good luck
to find my way, and keep my stockings clean."</p>

<p>An Englishman and a Bostonian, walking together
in Philadelphia, were heard to say, "how fatiguing it
is to pass thro this town! such a sameness in the whole!
no variety! when you have seen one street, you have
seen the whole town!"</p>

<p>These remarks, which are heard every day, illustrate
most strikingly the force of habit and tradition. The
influence of habit is every where known and felt; any
prepossessions therefore in favor of our nativ town, is
not a matter of surprise. But that a traditionary remark
or opinion should be handed from one generation
to another, and lead nations into error, without a detection
of its falsity, is a fact as astonishing as it is real.
Such is the opinion of the writers on the fine arts;
"that variety is pleasing;" an opinion embraced without
exception, and applied promiscuously to the works
of nature and of art. I have rarely met with a person,
not an inhabitant of Philadelphia, who would not say
he was disgusted with its regularity; and I am confident
that the opinion must proceed from that common
<span class="pb" id="Pg218">[pg 218]</span>
place remark, <i>that variety is pleasing</i>; otherwise men
could not so unanimously condemn what constitutes its
<i>greatest beauty</i>.</p>

<p>That in the productions of nature, variety constitutes
a principal part of beauty, and a fruitful source of pleasure,
will not be denied: But the beauty and agreeableness
of works of art depend on another principle, viz.
<i>utility or convenience</i>. The <i>design</i> of the work, or the
end proposed by it, must be attentivly considered before
we are qualified to judge of its <i>beauty</i>.</p>

<p>This kind of beauty is called by Lord Kaim,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" title="Elements of Criticism. Vol. I, page 198" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> <i>relativ
beauty</i>. He observes very justly, that "<i>intrinsic</i>
beauty is a perception of sense merely; for to perceive
the beauty of a spreading oak, or of a flowing river, no
more is required but singly an act of vision. <i>Relativ
beauty</i> is accompanied with an act of understanding and
reflection; for of a fine instrument or engine, we perceive
not the <i>relativ</i> beauty, until we are made acquainted
with its use and destination." A plow has not the
least <i>intrinsic</i> beauty; but when we attend to its <i>use</i>, we
are constrained to consider it as a <i>beautiful instrument</i>,
and such a view of it furnishes us with agreeable sensations.</p>

<p>The single question therefore, with respect to a town
or city, is this: <i>Is it planned and constructed for the greatest
possible convenience</i>? If so, it is completely beautiful.
If wide and regular streets are more useful and convenient
than those that are narrow and crooked, then a
city constructed upon a regular plan is the most beautiful,
however uniform the streets in their directions and
appearance.</p>

<p>I have often heard a comparison made between the
level roads of Holland and the uniform streets of Philadelphia.
A <i>dull sameness</i> is said to render both disagreeable.
Yet if a person will attentivly consider the
difference, I am persuaded he will be convinced that his
taste is but <i>half correct</i>; that is, that a just remark with
respect to a level open country, is improperly applied to
a commercial city. <i>Variety</i> in the works of nature is
<span class="pb" id="Pg219">[pg 219]</span>
pleasing; but never in the productions of art, unless in
copies of nature, or when that variety does not interfere
with <i>utility</i>. A level champaign country is rarely
convenient or useful; on the other hand, it is generally
more barren than a country diversified with hills and
vales. There is not generally any advantage to be derived
from a wide extended plain; the principle of <i>utility</i>,
therefore does not oppose and supersede the taste for
variety, and a tedious <i>sameness</i> is left to have its full effect
upon the mind of a spectator. This is the fact with
respect to the roads in Holland.</p>

<p>But it is otherwise in a city, which is built for the
express purpose of accommodating men in business.
We do not consider it as we do a landscape, an imitation
of a natural scene, and designed to please the eye;
but we attend to its uses in artificial society, and if it
appears to be calculated for the convenience of all classes
of citizens, the plan and construction must certainly
be beautiful, and afford us agreeable sensations.</p>

<p>The regularly built towns in America are Philadelphia,
Charleston, in South Carolina, and New Haven.
All these may be esteemed beautiful, tho not perfectly
so. Philadelphia wants a public square or place of resort
for men of business, with a spacious building for
an exchange. This should be near Market street, in
the center of business. The gardens at the State
House are too small for a public walk in that large city.
The whole line of bank houses<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" title="A line of houses built on the descent of land to the river, with a street adjacent to the houses on both sides." class="fnanchor">[61]</a> is the effect of ill
timed parsimony. The houses are inconvenient, and
therefore not pleasing to the eye; at the same time
they render Water street too narrow.</p>

<p>But whatever faults may be found in the construction
or plan of the city, its general appearance is agreeable,
and its <i>regularity</i> is its greatest beauty. Whenever
I hear a person exclaim against the uniformity that
pervades that city, I suppose him the dupe of a common
place remark, or that he believes a city built merely
to please the eye of a spectator.</p>

<p>
<span class="pb" id="Pg220">[pg 220]</span></p>

<p><i>Charleston</i> is situated upon low ground; but just above
high water mark. The soil is sand, which, with
a scarcity of stone, has prevented the streets from being
paved. The plan of the city is regular, but some of
the streets are too narrow. As it is almost surrounded
with water and low marshy ground, it was necessary to
attend to every circumstance that should contribute to
preserve a pure air. For this purpose, it was the original
design of the citizens, to prevent any buildings
from being erected on the wharves, in front of the
town; thus leaving a principal street, called the bay,
open to the sea breezes. Since the revolution, this design
has been partially dispensed with; and some buildings
erected on the water side of the bay, and particularly
one in front of the Exchange, which stands at
the head of Broad street, and commands an extensiv
view of the town on one side, and of the harbor on the
other. Should stores and warehouses be raised on the
wharves, to such a height as to intercept a view of the
harbor from the bay, they would diminish the beauty
of the town, and in some degree prevent the agreeable
effect of the cool breezes from the sea.</p>

<p><i>New Haven</i> was laid out on a most beautiful plan,
which has however suffered in the execution. The
streets cross each other at right angles, as in Philadelphia;
and divide the city into convenient squares. But
in the center is a large public square, the sides of which
are more than three hundred yards in length, and
adorned with rows of trees. Thro the center of this
square runs a line of elegant public buildings, viz. the
state house, two churches and a school house. This
square is a capital ornament to the town; but is liable
to two exceptions. First, it is too large for the populousness
of the city, which contains about 500 buildings.
In so small a town, it must generally be empty,
and consequently givs the town an appearance of solitude
or dullness. In the second place, that half of the
square which lies west of the public buildings, is occupied
mostly by the church yard, which is enclosed with
a circular fence. This reduces the public ground on
<span class="pb" id="Pg221">[pg 221]</span>
the opposit side to a paralellogram, which is a less beautiful
figure than a square; and annihilates the beauty
of the western division which it occupies. <ins class="corr" title="Nothwithstanding" id="C221">Notwithstanding</ins>
these circumstances, the green or public ground
in the center of New Haven, renders it perhaps the
most beautiful small settlement in America.</p>

<h2><span class="pb" id="Pg222">[pg 222]</span>No. XVIII.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<span class="ralign"><small>NEW YORK, MAY, 1788.</small></span></p>
<p class="center"><big><i>A</i> DISSERTATION <i>concerning the</i> INFLUENCE
<i>of</i> LANGUAGE <i>on</i> OPINIONS,
<i>and of</i> OPINIONS <i>on</i> LANGUAGE.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" title="This title, and many of the following ideas, are borrowed from a treatise of Mr. Michaelis, director of the Royal Society of Gottingen." class="fnanchor">[62]</a></big></p>

<p>The design of this dissertation is to show how far
truth and accuracy of thinking are concerned in
a clear understanding of <i>words</i>. I am sensible that in
the eye of prejudice and ignorance, grammatical researches
are the business of school boys; and hence we
may deduce the reason why philosophers have generally
been so inattentiv to this subject. But if it can
be proved that the <i>mere use of words</i> has led nations into
error, and still continues the delusion, we cannot
hesitate a moment to conclude, that grammatical enquiries
are worthy of the labor of <i>men</i>.</p>

<p>The Greek name of the Supreme Being, <i>Theos</i>, is
derived from <i>Theo, to run, or move one's self</i>. Hence
we discover the ideas which the Greeks originally entertained
of God, viz. that he was the <i>great principle
of motion</i>. The same word, it is said, was primarily
appropriated to the stars, as moving bodies; and it is
probable that, in the early ages of Greece, the heavenly
bodies might be esteemed Deities, and denominated
<i>Theoi, moving bodies</i> or <i>principles</i>. The Latin word
<i>Deus</i> was used to denote those inferior beings which
we call <i>spirits</i> or <i>angels</i>, or perhaps <i>one God</i> among several.
To giv the true idea of <i>Deus</i> in French and
English, the word should be rendered <i>le Dieu, the God</i>.
This at least may be said of the word, in its true <i>original</i>
sense; however it may have been used in the later
ages of Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg223">[pg 223]</span>
The English word <i>God</i>, is merely the old Saxon adjectiv
<i>god</i>, now spelt and pronounced <i>good</i>.</p>

<p>The German <i>Gott</i> is from the same root. The
words <i>God</i> and <i>good</i> therefore are synonimous. The
derivation of the word leads us to the notions which
our ancestors entertained of the Supreme Being; supposing
him to be the principle or author of good, they
called him, by way of eminence, <i>Good</i>, or <i>the Good</i>. By
long use and the progress of knowlege, the word is become
the name of the great Creator, and we have added
to it ideas of other attributes, as justice, power,
immutability, &amp;c. Had our heathen ancestors entertained
different ideas of the Deity; had they, for instance,
supposed justice to have been his leading attribute,
if I may use the term, they would have called him
<i>the just</i>; and this appellation, by being uniformly appropriated
to a certain invisible being, or supposed cause
of certain events, would in time have lost the article
<i>the</i>, and <i>just</i> would have become the <i>name</i> of the Deity.
Such is the influence of opinion in the formation of
language.</p>

<p>Let us now compare the names of the Deity in the
three languages; the Greek, <i>Theos</i>, denoting a <i>moving
being</i>, or the <i>principle of action</i>, evinces to us that the
Greeks gave the name to the <i>cause of events</i>, without
having very clear ideas of the nature or attributes of
that cause. They supposed the great operations of
nature to have each its cause; and hence the plurality
of causes, <i>theoi</i>, or moving principles.</p>

<p>The Romans borrowed the same word, <i>Deus</i>, and
used it to denote the celestial <i>agents</i> or <i>gods</i> which they
supposed to exist, and to superintend the affairs of the
universe.</p>

<p>Our northern ancestors had an idea that all favorable
events must have an efficient cause; and to this cause
they gave the name of <i>God</i> or <i>good</i>. Hence we observe
that the English and German words <i>God</i> and
<i>Got</i> do not convey precisely the same idea, as the <i>Theos</i>
and <i>Deus</i> of the Greeks and Romans. The former
cannot be used in the plural number; as they are the
<span class="pb" id="Pg224">[pg 224]</span>
names of a single indivisible being; the latter were used
as names common to a number of beings.</p>

<p>The word <i>Demon</i>, in Greek, was used to signify subordinate
deities, both good and evil. The Jews, who
had more perfect ideas of the Supreme Being, supposed
there could be but one good Deity, and consequently
that all the <i>demons</i> of the Greeks must be <i>evil</i> beings or
<i>devils</i>. In this sense alone they used the word, and this
restricted sense has been communicated thro Christian
countries in modern ages. The opinion of the Jews,
therefore, has had a material effect upon language, and
would lead us into an error respecting the Greek mythology;
unless we should trace the word <i>demon</i> to its
primitiv signification.</p>

<p>The word <i>devil</i>, in English, is merely a corruption
of <i>the evil</i>, occasioned by a rapid pronunciation. This
will not appear improbable to those who know, that in
some of the Saxon dialects, the character which we
write <i>th</i> is almost invariably written and pronounced <i>d</i>.
Hence we learn, the notion which our ancestors entertained
of the <i>cause of evil</i>, or of unfortunate events.
They probably ascribed such events to a malignant
principle, or being, which they called, by way of eminence,
<i>the evil</i>; and these words, corrupted by common
use, have given name to the being or principle.</p>

<p>I would only observe here that the etymology of
these two words, <i>God</i> and <i>devil</i>, proves that the Manichean
doctrine of a <i>good</i> and <i>evil</i> principle prevailed
among our northern ancestors. It has prevailed over
most of the eastern countries in all ages, and Christianity
admits the doctrine, with this improvement only, that
it supposes the <i>evil</i> principle to be subordinate to the
<i>good</i>. The supreme cause of events, Christians believe
to be <i>good</i> or <i>God</i>, for the words are radically the same;
the <i>cause of evil</i> they believe to be subordinate; yet,
strange as it may seem, they suppose the <i>subordinate evil</i>
principle to be the most prevalent.</p>

<p>We are informed by Ludolph, that the Ethiopeans,
having but one word for <i>nature</i> and <i>person</i>, could not
understand the controversy about Christ's two natures.
<span class="pb" id="Pg225">[pg 225]</span>
This is not surprising; nations, in a savage state, or
which have not been accustomed to metaphysical disquisitions,
have no terms to communicate abstract ideas,
which they never entertained; and hence the absurdity
of attempting to christianize savages. Before men can
be Christians they must be civilized; nay, they must
be philosophers. It is probable that many who are
called Christians, are in the state of the Ethiopians,
with respect to the same doctrin; and that they pass
thro life, without ever having any clear ideas of the
different natures of Christ. Yet the distinction is constantly
made in words; and that distinction passes for
a difference of ideas. Such is the influence of language
on opinion.</p>

<p>The words <i>soul</i>, <i>mind</i> and <i>spirit</i>, are constantly used
by people, and probably the difference of words has
given rise to an opinion that there is an actual difference
of things. Yet I very much question whether
the persons who use these words every day, annex any
distinct ideas to them; or if they do, whether they
could explain the difference.</p>

<p>The Greeks believed in the doctrin of transmigration.
They had observed the metamorphosis of the
caterpillar, and supposing the same soul to animate the
different bodies, and believing the soul to be perpetual
or immortal, they made the butterfly the hieroglyphic
of the soul: Hence the Greek word for soul, <i>psuke</i>,
came to signify also a <i>butterfly</i>.</p>

<p>For want of attending to the true etymology of the
word <i>glory</i>, false opinions have gained an establishment
in the world, and it may be hazardous to dispute them.
It is said that the <i>glory</i> of God does not depend on his
creatures, and that the glory of the good man depends
not on the opinion of others. But what is glory?
The Greek word <i>doxe</i> explains it. It is derived from
<i>dokeo, to think</i>; and signifies the <i>good opinion of others</i>.
This is its <i>true</i> original meaning; a man's glory therefore
consists in having the good opinion of men, and
this cannot generally be obtained, but by meritorious
actions. The <i>glory</i> of God consists in the exalted ideas
<span class="pb" id="Pg226">[pg 226]</span>
which his creatures entertain of his being and perfections.
His <i>glory</i> therefore depends <i>wholly on his creatures</i>.
The word is indeed often used to signify the
greatness, splendor or excellence of the divine character.
In this sense the <i>divine glory</i> may be independent
of created beings; but it is not the primitiv sense of
the word, nor the sense which answers to the original
meaning of the Greek <i>doxe</i>, and the Latin <i>gloria</i>.</p>

<p>No right in England and America is so much celebrated
as that of <i>trial by peers</i>; by which is commonly
understood, <i>trial by equals</i>. The right is valuable, but
is not derived from the primitiv custom of <i>trial by
equals</i>; on the contrary, it is very questionable whether
such a custom existed prior to Alfred. Yet the <i>trial by
peers</i> existed long before, and can be traced back to the
date of the Christian era. The truth is, the word <i>peer</i>
is not derived from the Latin <i>par</i>, equal; but from the
German, or Teutonic <i>bar</i> or <i>par</i>, which signified a
landholder, freeman or judge. The <i>bars</i> were that class
of men who held the <i>fees</i> or property in estates; and
from whom the word <i>baron</i> and the attendant privileges
are derived. We have the same root in <i>baron</i>,
<i>baronet</i>, <i>parliament</i>, <i>parish</i>, and many other words, all implying
some degree of authority, eminence or jurisdiction.
From the same word <i>bar</i> or <i>par</i>, (for <i>B</i> and <i>P</i>
are convertible letters) the word <i>peer</i> is derived, as it is
used in the common expressions <i>house of peers</i>, <i>trial by
peers</i>. It signified originally, not <i>equals</i>, but <i>judges</i> or
barons. The <i>house of peers</i> in England derives its appellation
and its jurisdiction from the ancient mode of
trial by <i>bars</i> or barons; for it is the final resort in all
judicial cases. Yet the ancient English lawyers, supposing
the word to be from the Latin <i>par</i>, equal, have
explained it in that sense, and multiplied encomiums
without end upon the excellence of the privilege. The
privilege is valuable, but its excellence, if it consists in a
<i>trial by equals</i>, is modern, compared with the original
custom, which was a <i>trial by barons</i>, or principal landholders.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg227">[pg 227]</span>
It is probable that our modern writers, misunderstanding
the term <i>voluptas</i>, have passed too severe censures
upon epicures. The true primitiv meaning of
<i>voluptas</i> was that of <i>pleasurable sensations</i> arising from innocent
gratifications. Our modern word <i>voluptuousness</i>
carries with it a much stronger idea, and hence we are
led into an error reflecting the doctrine of Epicurus,
who might confine his ideas of pleasure to innocent
gratifications.</p>

<p>We have been accustomed from childhood to hear
the expressions, <i>the dew falls</i>; <i>the dews of heaven</i>; and it
is probable that nine people out of ten, have never suspected
the inaccuracy of the phrases. But <i>dew</i> is
merely the perspiration of the earth; it <i>rises</i> instead of
<i>falling</i>, and rises during the night.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" title="Any person may prove this by a trifling experiment. Let him place a glass receiver or bowl over the grass in a summer's day, and the next morning he will find as much dew under it as around it. The truth is this; the particles of water are constantly exhaled from the earth by the heat of the sun. During the day time, these particles ascend in an imperceptible manner, and furnish the atmosphere with the materials of clouds and rain...." class="fnanchor">[63]</a> </p>

<p>It was also supposed that <i>manna</i> in the eastern countries,
came from above, and it is called in scripture
<i>bread from heaven</i>. Yet <i>manna</i> is a gum, exuding from
plants, trees and bushes, when pierced by certain insects.
The truth of this fact was not discovered, till
the middle of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Every man knows, when the prices of goods rise, it
is said they become <i>dear</i>; yet when the prices rise in
consequence of an overflowing sum of money in circulation,
the fact is that the <i>value of money falls</i>, and the
value of goods remains the same. This erroneous
opinion had an amazing effect in raising popular clamor,
at the commencement of the late revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg228">[pg 228]</span>
I will name but one other instance, which has a material
influence upon our moral and religious opinions.
It is said in scripture that <i>God hardened Pharaoh's heart</i>.
How? Was there a miracle in the case? By no means.
The manner of speaking leads us into the mistake.
The first cause is mentioned, and not the intermediate
cause or causes. So we should say, that <i>General Washington
attacked the British troops at Monmouth</i>; altho he
was at a great distance when the attack was commenced,
and only <i>ordered</i> the attack. I suspect that similar
modes of speaking in scripture often lead superficial
minds into mistakes, and in some instances, giv occasion
to infidels to scoff at passages, which, if rightly understood,
would silence all objections.</p>

<p>This is a fruitful theme, and would lead an ingenious
inquirer into a wide field of investigation. But I
have neither time nor talents to do it justice; the few
hints here suggested may have some effect in convincing
my readers of the importance and utility of all candid
researches into the origin and structure of speech; and
pave the way for further investigations, which may assist
us in correcting our ideas and ascertaining the force
and beauty of our own language.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="ralign"><small>PHILADELPHIA, 1787.</small></span></p>
<p class="center"><big><i>On</i> VOCAL MUSIC.</big></p>

<p>The establishment of schools for teaching psalmody
in this city is a pleasing institution; but people
seem not to understand the design, or rather are not
aware of the advantages which may result from it, if
properly conducted and encouraged. Most people consider
music merely as a source of pleasure; not attending
to its influence on the human mind, and its consequent
effects on society. But it should be regarded as
an article of education, <i>useful</i> as well as ornamental.</p>

<p>The human mind is formed for activity; and will
ever be employed in business or diversions. Children
are perpetually in motion, and all the ingenuity of their
parents and guardians should be exerted to devise
methods for restraining this activ principle, and directing
it to some <i>useful</i> object, or to <i>harmless trifles</i>. If
this is not done, their propensity to action, even without
a vicious motiv, will hurry them into follies and
crimes. Every thing innocent, that attracts the attention
of children, and will employ their minds in
leisure hours, when idleness might otherwise open the
way to vice, must be considered as a valuable employment.
Of this kind is vocal music. There were instances
of youth, the last winter, who voluntarily attended
a singing school in preference to the theatre. It
is but reasonable to suppose, that if they would neglect
a theatre for singing, they would neglect a thousand
amusements, less engaging, and more pernicious.</p>

<p>Instrumental music is generally prefered to vocal,
and considered as an elegant accomplishment. It is
indeed a pleasing accomplishment; but the preference
given to it, is a species of the same false taste, which
places a son under the tuition of a <i>drunken clown</i>, to
make him a gentleman of <i>strict morals</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg230">[pg 230]</span>
Instrumental music may exceed vocal in some nice
touches and distinctions of sound; but when regarded
as to its effects upon the mind and upon society, it is as
inferior to vocal, as sound is inferior to sense. It is
very easy for a spruce beau to display a contempt for
vocal music, and to say that human invention has gone
beyond the works of God Almighty. But till the
system of creation shall be new modelled, the human
voice properly cultivated will be capable of making the
most perfect music. It is neglected; sol faing is unfashionable,
and that is enough to damn it: But people
who have not been acquainted with the perfection
of psalmody, are incapable of making a suitable comparison
between vocal and instrumental music. I have
often heard the best vocal concerts in America, and the
best instrumental concerts; and can declare, that the
music of the latter is as inferior to that of the former,
as the merit of a <i>band box macaroni</i> is to that of a Cato.</p>

<p>Instrumental music affords an agreeable amusement;
and as an amusement it ought to be cultivated.
But the advantage is private and limited; it pleases the
ear, but leaves no impression upon the heart.</p>

<p>The design of music is to awaken the passions, to
soften the heart for the reception of sentiment. To
awaken passion is within the power of instruments, and
this may afford a temporary pleasure; but society derives
no advantage from it, unless some useful sentiment
is left upon the heart.</p>

<p>Instruments are secondary in their use; they were
invented originally, not to supercede, but to assist the
voice. The first histories of all nations were written
in verse, and sung by their bards. In later ages, the
<i>oaten reed</i>, the <i>harp</i> and the <i>lyre</i>, were found to improve
the pleasures of music; but the neglect of the voice
and of sentiment was reserved for modern corruption.
Ignorant indeed is the man, and possessed of a wretched
taste, who can seriously despise the humble pleasures
of vocal music, and prefer the bare harmony of sounds.
Sentiment should ever accompany music; the sounds
should ever correspond with the ideas, otherwise music
<span class="pb" id="Pg231">[pg 231]</span>
loses all its force. Union of sentiment, with harmony
of sounds, is the perfection of music. Every string of
the human heart may be touched; every passion roused
by the different kinds of sounds; the courage of the
warrior; the cruelty of the tyrant; anger; grief; love,
with all its sensibilities, are subject to the influence of
music. Even brutes acknowlege its effects; but while
they in common with man feel the effects of a harmony
of mere sounds, man enjoys the superior felicity of
receiving sentiment; and while he relishes the pleasures
of chords in sound, he imbibes a disposition to communicate
happiness to society.</p>

<p>Seldom indeed do men reflect on the connexion between
the chords of music and the social affections.
Morality is to immorality, what harmony is to discord.
Society detests vice, and the ear is offended with discordant
sounds. Society is pleased and happified with
virtue, and the ear is delighted with harmony. This
beautiful analogy points out the utility of cultivating
music as a science. Harsh discordant sounds excite
the peevish malevolent passions; harmonious sounds
correct and soften the rougher passions.</p>

<p>Every person will acknowlege, that love refines the
heart, and renders it more susceptible, and more capable
of social virtue. It is for this reason that men who
have particular attachments to women, or associate
much with ladies of delicacy, are more disposed to do
acts of kindness, in every sphere of life, than those who
seldom frequent ladies company. On the other hand,
anger, jealousy, envy, are dissocial passions; and even
when they are excited by a single object, they poison
the heart, and disqualify it for exciting the social affections
towards any of the human race. Every institution,
therefore, calculated to prepare the human heart
for exerting the social virtues, and to suppress or check
the malignant passions, must be highly beneficial to society;
and such I consider establishments in favor of
vocal music. Happy, indeed, should I feel, could I see
youth devoted every where to the refinement of their
voices and morals; to see them prefer moral or religious
<span class="pb" id="Pg232">[pg 232]</span>
pieces to the indecent songs or low diversions
which taint the mind in early life, and diffuse their pernicious
influence through society.</p>

<p>If the poison of the tarantula may be counteracted
by music; if the Spanish ladies are won by nocturnal
serenades; if the soldier is inspired with courage by the
martial sounds of the trumpet, and the Christian impressed
with devout sentiments by the solemn tones of
the organ; what advantage may society derive from
the softening harmony of choirs of voices, celebrating
the praises of social virtue! Happy days! when <i>false
taste</i> and <i>false opinions</i> shall vanish before the progress of
<i>truth</i>; when princes shall resume their ancient and honorable
task of teaching the young to be <i>good</i> and <i>great</i>;
when an Addison shall be preferred to a Chesterfield;
when the wealth of nations shall be no longer lavished
upon fiddlers and dancers; when the characters of a
<i>Benezet</i> and a <span class="smcap">Washington</span> shall obscure the glories
of a CÃ¦sar; and when no man shall be ashamed to be
<i>good</i>, because it is unfashionable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="ralign"><small>NEW YORK, JUNE, 1788.</small></span></p>
<p class="center"><big><i>On</i> MORALITY.</big></p>

<p>"The principles of morality are little understood
among savages," says Lord Kaimes, "and if
they arrive to maturity among enlightened nations, it
is by slow degrees."</p>

<p>With submission to that writer, I would advance
another position equally true, "that the principles of
eating and drinking are little understood by savages,
and if they arrive to maturity among civilized nations,
it is by slow degrees."</p>

<p>The truth is, morality consists in discharging the social
duties of life; and so far as the state of savages requires
an intercourse of duties, the moral principles
seem to be as perfect in them as in more enlightened
nations. Savages in a perfectly rude state have little
or no commerce; the transactions between man and
man are confined to very few objects, and consequently
the laws which regulate their intercourse and distribute
justice, must be few and simple.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" title="It is a fact, supported by unquestionable testimony, that the savage nations on the frontiers of these States, have fewer vices in proportion to their virtues, than are to be found in the best regulated civilized societies with which we are acquainted." class="fnanchor">[64]</a> But the crime
of murder is as severely punished by savages, as by civilized
nations. Nay, I question whether it is possible
to name the barbarous tribe, which suffers an individual
to take the life of another, upon as easy terms as
the modern feudal Barons in Europe may do that of a
vassal; or with the same impunity that a planter in the
West Indies takes the life of a slave. I speak of a time
of peace, and of the conduct of savages towards their
own tribes. As to war, every nation of savages has its
<span class="pb" id="Pg234">[pg 234]</span>
arbitrary customs, and so has every civilized nation.
Savages are generally partial and capricious in the
treatment of their prisoners; some they treat with a
singular humanity; and others they put to death with
the severest cruelty. Well, do not civilized people the
same? Did a savage ever endure greater torments, than
thousands of prisoners during the late war? But not to
mention the practice of a single nation, at a single period;
let us advert to a general rule among civilized
nations; that it is lawful to put to death prisoners taken
in a garrison by storm. The practice grounded on
this rule, is as direct and as enormous a violation of
the laws of morality, as the slow deliberate tortures exercised
by the most barbarous savages on earth.</p>

<p>Well, what are the ideas of savages respecting <i>theft</i>?
How do they differ from those of an enlightened people?
Many things are possessed in common, as provisions
taken in hunting, corn, &amp;c. Ferdinand de Soto
relates, that the tribes (and he visited hundreds in
Florida) had public granaries of corn laid up for winter,
which was distributed by authority to each family,
according to its number. But for an individual to
take from this common stock without license, was considered
as a criminal defrauding of the public. And
with regard to the few articles, in which individuals
acquire private property, the savages have as correct
ideas of <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>, of theft, trespass, &amp;c. and are
as careful to guard private property from invasion, by
laws and penalties, as any civilized people. The laws
of the Creeks, the Cherokees, the Six Nations, &amp;c. with
regard to these and many other crimes, in point of reason
and equity, stand on a footing with those of the most
civilized nations; and in point of execution and observance,
their administration would do honor to any
government. Among most savage nations there is a
kind of monarchy which is efficient in administration;
and among those tribes which have had no intercourse
with civilized nations, and which have not been deceived
by the tricks of traders; the common arts of
cheating, by which millions of enlightened people get
<span class="pb" id="Pg235">[pg 235]</span>
a living or a fortune, are wholly unknown. This is
an incontrovertible fact. I lately became acquainted
with a lad of about twelve years old, who was taken
captiv by the Indians in 1778, while a child, and had continued
with them till about ten years old. He had no
recollection of the time when he was taken, and consequently
his mind could not have been corrupted among
the English. When he was restored, agreeable
to the treaty, he was a perfect savage; but what I relate
the circumstance for, is this; the lad was not addicted
to a single vice. He was instant and cheerful in
obeying commands; having not even a disposition to
refuse or evade a compliance. He had no inclination
to lie or steal; on the other hand, he was always surprised
to find a person saying one thing and meaning
another. In short, he knew not any thing but honesty
and undisguised frankness and integrity. A single
instance does not indeed establish a general rule; but
those who are acquainted with the nativs of America
can testify that this is the general character of savages
who are not corrupted by the vices of civilized nations.</p>

<p>But it is said savages are revengeful; their hatred is
hereditary and perpetual. How does this differ from
the hatred of civilized nations? I question much
whether the principle of revenge is not as perfect in
enlightened nations, as in savages. The difference is
this; a savage hunts the man who has offended him,
like a wild beast, and assassinates him wherever he finds
him; the <i>gentleman</i> pursues his enemy or his rival with
as much rancor as a savage, and even stoops to notice
little affronts, that a savage would overlook; but he
does not stab him privately; he hazards his own life
with that of his enemy, and one or both are very <i>honorably</i>
murdered. The principle of revenge is equally
activ in both cases; but its operation is regulated by
certain arbitrary customs. A savage is open and avows
his revenge, and kills privately; the polite and well
bred take revenge in a more <i>honorable</i> way, when <i>life</i> is
to be the price of satisfaction; but in cases of small affronts,
they are content with privately stabbing the
<span class="pb" id="Pg236">[pg 236]</span>
reputation or ruining the fortunes of their enemies. In
short, the passions of a savage are under no restraint;
the passions of enlightened people are restrained and
regulated by a thousand civil laws and accidental circumstances
of society.</p>

<p>But it will be objected, if savages understood principles
of morality, they would lay such passions under
restraint. Not at all: Civil and political regulations
are not made, because the things prohibited are in their
own nature wrong; but because they produce inconveniencies
to society. The most enlightened nations
do not found their laws and penalties on an abstract
regard to <i>wrong</i>; nor has government any concern
with that which has no influence on the peace and
safety of society. If savages, therefore, leave every
man to take his own revenge, it is a proof that they
judge it the best mode of preventing the necessity of
it; that is, they think their society and government
safer under such a license, than under regulations which
should control the passions of individuals. They may
have their ideas of the nature of revenge independent
of society; but it will be extremely difficult to prove,
that, abstracted from a regard to a Deity and to society,
there is such a thing as <i>right</i> and <i>wrong</i>. I consider
<i>morality</i> merely as it respects <i>society</i>; for if we superadd
the obligations of a divine command, we blend
it with <i>religion</i>; an article in which Christians have an
infinit advantage over savages.</p>

<p>Considering moral duties as founded solely on the
constitution of society, and as having for their sole end
the happiness of social beings, many of them will vary
in their nature and extent, according to the particular
state and circumstances of any society.</p>

<p>Among the ancient Britons, a singular custom prevailed;
which was, a community of wives by common
consent. Every man married one woman; but a
number, perhaps ten or twelve, relations or neighbors,
agreed to possess their wives in common. Every woman's
children were accounted the children of her husband;
but every man had a share in the common defence
<span class="pb" id="Pg237">[pg 237]</span>
and care of this little community.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" title="Uxores habent deni, duodenique inter se communes; et maxime fratres cum fratribus, et parentes cum liberis. Sed si qui sunt ex his nati; eorum habentur liberi a quibus primum virgines quÃ¦que ductÃ¦ sunt.---- CÃ¦sar de bell. Gall. Lib. 5." class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Was this
any breach of morality? Not in the least. A British
woman, in the time of Severus, having become intimate
with Julia Augusta, and other ladies, at the court
of Rome, had observed what passed behind the curtain;
and being one day reproached for this custom of the
Britons, as infamous in the women, and barbarous in
the men; she replied, "We do that <i>openly</i> with the
<i>best</i> of our men, which you do <i>privately</i> with the <i>worst</i>
of yours." This custom, so far from being infamous
or barbarous, originated in public and private convenience.
It prevented jealousy and the injuries of adultery,
in a state where private wrongs could not easily
be prevented or redressed. It might be an excellent
substitute for penal laws and a regular administration
of justice. But there is a better reason for the custom,
which writers seem to have overlooked; and this is,
that a community multiplied the chances of subsistence
and security. In a savage life, subsistence is precarious,
for it depends on contingent supplies by hunting and
fishing. If every individual, therefore, should depend
solely on his own good luck, and fail of success, his
family must starve. But in a community of twelve,
the probability that some one would procure provisions
is increased as twelve to one. Hence the community
of provisions among most savage nations.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" title="Let an individual depend solely on his own exertions for food, and a single failure of crops subjects him to a famin. Let a populous country depend solely on its own produce, and the probability of a famine is diminished; yet is still possible. But a commercial intercourse between all nations, multiplies the chances of subsistence, and reduces the matter to a certainty. China, a well peopled country, is subject to a famin merely for want of a free commerce." class="fnanchor">[66]</a> </p>

<p>The Britons, when the Romans first visited their
island, did not attend much to the cultivation of the
earth. "Interiores plerique," says CÃ¦sar, "frumenta
<span class="pb" id="Pg238">[pg 238]</span>
non serunt, sed lacte et carne vivunt." By establishing
a community of goods, they secured themselves against
the hazard of want; and by a community of wives and
offspring, they confirmed the obligations of each to superintend
the whole; or rather, changed into a natural
obligation what might otherwise depend on the feebler
force of positiv compact. Besides, it is very possible
that personal safety from the invasion of tribes or individuals,
might be another motiv for establishing these
singular communities. At any rate, we must suppose
that the Britons had good civil or political reasons for
this custom; for even savages do not act without reason.
And if they found society more safe and happy,
with such a custom than without it, it was most undoubtedly
right.</p>

<p>Should it be said, that a community is prohibited by
divine command; I would answer that it is not presumable
that the old Britons had any positiv revelation;
and I do not know that the law of nature will
decide against their practice. The commands given
to the Jews were positiv injunctions; but they by no
means extend to all nations, farther than as they are
founded on <i>immutable principles</i> of right and wrong in
all societies. Many of the Mosaic precepts are of this
kind; they are unlimited in their extent, because they
stand on principles which are unlimited in their operation.</p>

<p>Adultery is forbidden in the Jewish laws; and so it
is in the codes of other nations. But adultery may be
defined differently by different nations; and the criminality
of it depends on the particular positiv institutions,
or accidental circumstances of a nation. The
same reasons that would render a similar custom in
civilized modern nations highly criminal, might render
it innocent and even necessary among the old Britons.
A prohibition to gather sticks on the Sabbath, under a
penalty of death for disobedience, might be founded on
good reasons among the ancient Jews; but it would
be hard to prove that a modern law of the same kind,
would be warrantable in any nation.</p>

<p class="center"><big><i>A</i> LETTER <i>from a</i> LADY, <i>with</i> REMARKS.</big></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">sir</em></span>,</p>

<p>As you have, in your writings, discovered that you
take a particular interest in the happiness of ladies,
I hope you will not deem it a deviation from delicacy, if
one of them offers you her grateful acknowlegements,
and requests you to giv your sentiments upon what will
be here related.</p>

<p>About four years ago, I was visited by a gentleman
who professed an unalterable attachment for me. He
being a genteel, sensible and handsome man, I thought
myself justifiable in treating him with complacency.
After I was convinced by his constant attention and frequent
professions, that I was a favorite, he used frequently
to upbraid me, for being so silent and reserved:
It shewed, he said, a want of confidence in him; for I
must be sensible he derived the greatest pleasure imaginable
in my conversation, and why would I then deprive
him of the greatest happiness by absenting myself, when
he paid a visit, refusing to chat with my usual freedom.
Tho he professed himself to be an admirer of
candor, and a strict adherer to the rules of honor, still I
could not but doubt his sincerity from the extravagance
of his expressions. This he considered as an affront,
saying that no man of <i>honor</i> would express sentiments
that were not genuine. I found myself unwilling to
say any thing that should be disagreeable, and disposed
to make him understand by an attention that I supposed
him entitled to, that he was prefered to any other person.
He continued his visits in this manner for about
eighteen months, conducting himself with the greatest
delicacy, affection and respect. During this time, he
<span class="pb" id="Pg240">[pg 240]</span>
never expressed a wish to be united, which made me uneasy,
as I knew that all my friends thought us engaged.
At last I told him his attention was too particular; I
knew not what construction to put upon it. He replied
that I was too particular in my ideas; it was a convincing
proof to him, with my resenting <i>trifling liberties</i>,
that I had not an affection for him, and that he
was not the man I wished to be connected with; therefore
he would not trouble me any longer with his company,
and wished me a good night.</p>

<p>This, Sir, you must suppose, distressed me greatly;
I viewed myself injured and trifled with, but knew not
how to obtain redress. My attachment and pride
were so great that I would not allow my friends to call
him to an account for his behavior; tho I now despise
his conduct, and would refuse him the hand of which
he has proved himself unworthy, still I feel hurt at the
treatment I have received. You, Sir, as a friend to
our sex, and one who wishes to preserve the peace of
mind of unsuspecting girls, will do them an essential service,
by your animadversions on these facts, and guarding
our sex from similar impositions.</p>

<p>These circumstances would not have been related,
were I not rendered discontented and wretched at home,
in consequence of refusing the offers of three other
gentlemen; either of whom would doubtless have
been acceptable, had not my affections been preengaged
to one who has proved himself worthless. Their
characters and situations in life are equal to my wishes;
but I cannot do them so much injustice and myself so
much injury, as to giv my hand unaccompanied with
my heart. In consulting my own inclinations I have
incurred the displeasure of all my family; they treat me
with great inattention, and are continually reflecting
on my want of spirit and resolution. I am confident,
Sir, that every generous mind will pity your unhappy
and distressed friend,</p>

<p class="indent">CONSTANTIA.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pb" id="Pg241">[pg 241]</span><i>To</i> CONSTANTIA.</p>

<p>While I acknowlege myself honored by your correspondence,
and happy in an opportunity of rendering
you or your sex the least service, permit me, in compliance
with your request, which shall be to me a sacred
law, to offer my sentiments with a frankness, corresponding
with that which marks the relation of your
misfortunes. For altho I feel the warmest indignation
at every species of deception, and particularly at that
long continued inexplicitness which is <i>deliberate deception</i>,
and which is the cause of your wretchedness, candor
and truth require that censure should fall where it
is due.</p>

<p>If the slightest blame can fall on you, it is that you
indulged the visits of a gentleman for <i>eighteen months
without an explicit and honorable declaration of his intention</i>.
A <i>delicate</i>, <i>affectionate</i> and <i>respectful</i> attention to a
lady, for one quarter of that period, is sufficient to make
an impression on her mind, and decide her choice: At
the same time, it might not render an attachment on
her part, so strong as to make a separation very painful;
it might not giv the world an opinion that an engagement
exists, or subject the lady to the necessity of
dismissing other suitors. It is therefore prudent at least
for a lady to conduct herself in such a manner as to
bring her admirer to an explicit declaration of his designs.
A man of <i>real honor</i> and principle would not
wait for a stratagem on the part of the lady, or for a
frank demand of an explanation of his conduct. A
tolerable acquaintance with the human heart would
enable him to discover when a declaration would be
<i>agreeable</i> to the lady, and after this discovery, he would
not keep her a moment in suspense. A man of generous
feelings, who has a lively attachment, looks with
anxiety for some proof that his addresses are agreeable,
and that a declaration of his intentions will be well received.
No sooner does he find this proof, than he hastens
to unbosom himself to the dear object of his wishes,
<span class="pb" id="Pg242">[pg 242]</span>
and communicate the happiness he so ardently desires
to receive. When therefore a man neglects such a declaration,
after he has had convincing proofs that his offers
would be well received, it may and should be taken for
granted that his intentions are not honorable, and the
lady should treat him accordingly. If therefore, my
unhappy friend, you deserve the least degree of censure,
it is because you delayed too long to take measures for
undeceiving yourself. Yet this delay is a proof of
your unsuspecting confidence and sincere attachment;
and faults, proceeding from such amiable causes, are
almost changed to virtues; in your sex, they entitle the
sufferer to forgivness and to love.</p>

<p>You inform me, Constantia, that the man who has
injured you, professed to <i>adhere to the rules of honor</i>.
Never, Constantia, trust a man who deals largely in
that <ins class="corr" title="hackeyned" id="C242">hackneyed</ins> virtue, <i>honor</i>. <i>Honor</i>, in the fashionable
sense of the word, is but another name for <i>villany</i>.
The <i>man of honor</i> would not be guilty of the least impropriety
in public company; he would not for the world
neglect the least punctilio of the customary etiquette,
but he would, without hesitation or remorse, blow out
the brains of a friend, for treading on his toe, or rob
an amiable woman of her reputation and happiness to
gratify his vanity.</p>

<p>If a man talks too much of his <i>honor</i>, he is to be
avoided, like the midnight ruffian. He that really
possesses a virtue never boasts of it, for he does not suspect
the world think him destitute of it. Numerous
professions are commonly mere substitutes for what is
professed.</p>

<p>The man, who has given you so much uneasiness,
never deserved the confidence he won; he must be destitute
of principle, of virtue, and of attachment to
you. His deliberate ill usage proves him to be callous
to every tender emotion, and to deserve your contempt.
Will not a generous pride and detestation expel the least
sentiment of respect for him from your breast? Can
you not forget that you have been misled, and will not
your innocence buoy you above misfortunes? That
<span class="pb" id="Pg243">[pg 243]</span>
you have refused good offers, is to be regretted; but
your friends, if they know the reason, as they ought,
will not pain you by disingenuous reflections. On the
other hand, they will assist you in finding objects to amuse
you and dissipate your own melancholy reflections.
Smile away the anxiety that shuts your heart
against other impressions. Base as men are, there may
be some found who despise the character of him who
has given even an hour's pain; there may be one who
knows <i>your</i> worth, and may be disposed to reward your
<i>constancy</i>.</p>

<p>It is a mortifying reflection to an honest mind, that
<i>bad</i> hearts are so often suffered to giv pain to the <i>good</i>;
that the <i>trifling</i> and the <i>base</i> of our sex are not constrained,
by necessity, to associate only with the <i>trifling</i> and
the <i>base</i> of yours, and that the good, the generous and
the constant should be exposed to the abuses of the fickle
and designing. But such is the constitution of society,
and for the evils of it, we have no remedy, but
cautious circumspection to prevent, or patient fortitude
to support the adverse events of our conditions.</p>

<p>No man can entertain a more cordial detestation of
the smallest disposition to annoy the peace of mind and
disturb the tranquillity of mankind, than myself; the
design of existence here is to sooth the evils, and multiply
the felicities of each other, and he must be a villain
indeed, who can deliberately attempt to poison the
sources of pleasure, by crossing and disappointing the
social passions.</p>

<p>To your sex, Constantia, permit me to giv a word of
caution; never to make any inquiries about a man's
family, fortune or accomplishments, till you know
whether he is a man of <i>principle</i>. By <i>principle</i>, I mean,
a disposition of heart to conduct with strict propriety,
both as a moral being and as a member of civil society;
that is, a disposition to increase the happiness of all around
him. If he appears to wish for his own gratification,
at the expense even of a servant's happiness, he
is an unsocial being, he is not a fit associate for men,
much less for amiable women. If he is a man of
<span class="pb" id="Pg244">[pg 244]</span>
<i>principle</i>, then proceed to inquire into his standing in
life. <i>With</i> principle he may make a woman happy in
almost any circumstances; <i>without</i> it, <i>birth</i>, <i>fortune</i> and
<i>education</i> serve but to render his worthlessness the more
conspicuous. With sentiments of esteem, I am your
obliged friend, and humble servant,</p>

<p class="center"><big><i>A</i> LETTER <i>to the</i> AUTHOR, <i>with</i> REMARKS.</big></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">sir</em></span>,</p>

<p>I beg leave to relate to you a few circumstances
respecting the conduct of a young friend of mine in
this city, and to request your own remarks and advice
on the occasion. Should any other person similarly
situated, be disposed to receive benefit from the advice,
I shall be much gratified, and my design more than answered.</p>

<p>This young friend to whom I allude, has been till
within a few years, under the watchful eyes of very attentiv
parents; from whom he received much better
advice and much more of it, than the generality of
parents in this city are wont to bestow on their children;
they taught him to regard truth with a steady attachment;
in short his education, till their deaths, was
such as might with propriety have been called rigidly
virtuous. Since that instructiv period, he has been under
the guidance of no one but himself; his former associates
with whom he grew up, and for whom he still
feels a degree of schoolmate attachment, are almost
universally debauched characters. The force of example
is great, and let it be mentioned to his honor, that
in general he has had sufficient virtue to resist their importunities,
and to follow a line of conduct directly
contrary to the one they would gladly have marked out
for his pursuance. He possesses many of the social virtues,
and is warmly attached to the amiable part of the
female world. This attachment has preserved him
from the fashionable vices of the age, and given him a
relish for domestic happiness, which I think he will
never lose. A young gentleman so capable of making
<span class="pb" id="Pg246">[pg 246]</span>
himself agreeable to good and virtuous characters,
ought not, in my opinion, to indulge himself in any
practices, that shall tend in the least to depreciate his
general merit. The practices I would mention, are
few and not very considerable; still I think he should
dismiss them entirely, or at least not indulge them to
his disadvantage. He sings a <i>good song</i>, and he knows it
tolerably well; he is often urged into company on that
account; he can make himself agreeable withal, and is
really a <i>musical companion</i>; he pays so much attention
to <i>learning</i> and <i>singing songs</i>, that he has but little leisure
time on his hands; he reads part of the day, but he
reads principally <i>novels</i> or <i>song books</i>. I would not be
understood to consider <i>singing songs</i> as criminal; far
from it; I am often delighted with a song from him;
but the query with me is, whether he ought not to devote
part of the time which he now employs about
what may be called genteel trifling, to the improvement
of his mind in a manner that may be of lasting benefit
to him; I wish you to giv him your advice, and direct
him what books to read. He has another <i>fault</i>, which,
altho it originates in the benevolence of his disposition,
may still be called a fault. He has a very susceptible
heart, and opens it with a generous freedom, so much
so that he sometimes forgets himself, and opens it
where he ought not to do. A stranger with a specious
outside might easily impose on him. I just throw out
these hints, that he may be on his guard against those
whose business it is to deceive. There are several
smaller faults dependant upon, or rather consequent to,
those I have mentioned, which I at first intended to
have enumerated, but if the first are amended, the others
will forsake him of course.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The</i> ANSWER.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">sir</em></span>,</p>

<p>By the description you have given of your young
friend, it appears that he is rather <i>trifling</i> and <i>inconsiderate</i>
than <i>profligate</i>. His faults are, <i>his spending too
<span class="pb" id="Pg247">[pg 247]</span>
much time in learning and singing songs</i>; and too <i>much
frankness of heart</i>, which exposes him to impositions.
But you have not, Sir, informed me whether he was
<i>bred to business</i>; and by his character, I judge that he
was not. He has had good precepts indeed; but of
how little weight are precepts to young people! Advice
to the young sometimes does good; but perhaps never,
except good habits have been previously formed by correct
discipline in manners, or by a mechanical attention
to honest employments. The truth is, advice or serious
council is commonly lavished where it does no
good, upon the young, the gay, the thoughtless; whose
passions are strong, before reason begins to have the
smallest influence. I am young myself, but from the
observations I have hitherto made, I venture to affirm,
that grave advice never yet conquered a passion, and
rarely has restrained one so as to render a sprightly
youth, in any degree serious. How should it? Instructions
are transient; they seldom touch the heart,
and they generally oppose passions that are vigorous,
and which are incessantly urging for indulgence.</p>

<p>I have ever thought that advice to the young, unaccompanied
by the routine of honest employments,
is like an attempt to make a shrub grow in a certain
direction, by blowing it with a bellows. The way to
regulate the growth of a vegetable is to <i>confine</i> it to the
proposed direction. The only effectual method perhaps
is to keep young persons from childhood busy in
some employment of use and reputation. It is very
immaterial what that employment is; the mind will
grow in the direction given it at first; it will bend and
attach itself to the business, and will not easily lose that
bent or attachment afterwards: The mind <i>will</i> attach
itself to something; its natural disposition is to pleasure
and amusement. This disposition may be changed
or overcome by keeping the mind, from early life,
busy in some useful occupation, and perhaps by <i>nothing
else</i>. Advice will not produce the effect.</p>

<p>I suspect, Sir, that your young friend has been bred
a trifler; that he has had money to support him without
<span class="pb" id="Pg248">[pg 248]</span>
the labor of acquiring it; that he has never been
anxious about his future subsistence. If so, his education
must be pronounced erroneous. Whether worth
twenty pounds or twenty thousand, it should make no
difference in his attention to business while young.
We are the creatures of habit; a habit of <i>acquiring</i>
property should always precede the <i>use</i> of it, otherwise
it will not be used with credit and advantage. Besides,
business is almost the only security we have for moral
rectitude and for consequence in society. It keeps a
young person out of vicious company; it operates as a
constant check upon the passions, and while it does not
destroy them, it restrains their intemperance; it
strengthens the mind by exercise, and puts a young
person upon exerting his reasoning faculties. In short,
a man bred to business loves society, and feels the importance
of the principles that support it. On the other
hand, mankind respect him; and whatever your
young friend may think of the assertion, it is true that
the ladies uniformly despise a man who is always dangling
at their apron strings, and whose principal excellence
consists in singing a good song.</p>

<p>If, Sir, your friend is still so young, as to undergo
the discipline of a professional or other employment,
his habits of trifling may be changed by this means;
but if he is so far the gentleman as to disdain business,
his friends have only to whistle advice in his ears, and
wait till old age, experience, and the death of his passions,
shall change the man.</p>

<p>Accept of my thanks, Sir, for this communication,
and be assured that my opinion on any subject of this
kind will always be at your service.</p>

<p class="center"><big><i>An</i> <span class="smcap">Enquiry</span> <i>into the</i> <span class="smcap">Origin</span> <i>of the</i> <span class="smcap">Words</span>
DOMESDAY, PARISH, PARLIAMENT,
PEER, BARON; <i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Remarks,
New</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Interesting</span>.</big></p>

<p>In the course of my etymological investigations, I
hav been led to suspect that all the writers on the
laws and constitution of England, hav mistaken the origin
and primitiv signification of several words of high
antiquity, and in consequence of the mistake, hav adopted
some erroneous opinions, respecting the history of
parliaments and trial by peers. Whether my own
opinions are wel supported by history and etymology,
must be hereafter decided by able and impartial judges
of this subject.</p>

<p><i>Dome book</i>, or <i>domesday book</i>, iz a word wel understood
by English lawyers. <i>Dome book</i>, or <i>dom bec</i>, az it waz
formerly spelt, waz the name given to the Saxon code
of laws compiled by Alfred. Some other codes of local
customs or laws were also denominated <i>dom becs</i>, but
theze are all lost. After the conquest, a general survey
of all the lands in England, except a few counties, waz
made by order of William, and recorded in a volum
which iz stil extant, and called <i>domesday</i>. This survey
waz begun by five justices assigned for the purpose in
each county, in the year 1081 and completed 1086.</p>

<p>Our pious ancestors were not a little frightened at
the name of this book, which iz usually pronounced
<i>doomsday</i>; supposing it to hav some reference to the final
doom, or day of judgement. In order to quiet
such apprehensions, lawyers of less credulity undertook
to refute the common opinion. Jacob, after Cowel,
very gravely asserts, that the termination <i>day</i> in this
word does not allude to the general judgement. "The
<span class="pb" id="Pg250">[pg 250]</span>
addition of <i>day</i> to this dome book, waz not ment with
any allusion to the final day of judgement, az <i>most persons
hav conceeved</i>, but waz to strengthen and confirm
it, and signifieth the judicial decisiv record, or book of
<i>dooming</i> judgement and justice."<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" title="Jacob Dict. word, domesday." class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The same author
defines <i>domesmen</i> to be <i>judges</i>, or men appointed to
<i>doom</i>.</p>

<p>Cowel, a compiler of considerable authority, says,
"day or dey," (for <i>dey</i> iz the true spelling) "does not
augment the sense, but only doubles and confirms the
same meening. It does not, in this composition, really
signify the mesure of time, but the administration
of justice; so that <i>domesday</i> iz more emphatically the
judicial decisiv record, the book of <i>dooming</i> judgement."<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" title="Cowel Dict. Daysman." class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
According to this author, then, <i>domesday</i> iz
<i>a judgement of judgements</i>, for he quotes Dr. Hammond
to proov that <i>day</i>, <i>dies</i>, Î·Î¼ÎµÏÎ±, in all idioms, signifies
judgement. However tru this may be, I beleev our
Saxon forefathers could find a better name for a code
of laws, than <i>a judgement of judgements</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>Domesday</i>," says Coke, "dies judicii," day of
judgement.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" title="Coke Litt. 3. 248." class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Such is the influence of sounds upon
credulous, superstitious minds.</p>

<p>The truth seems to be this; <i>domesday</i> is a compound
of <i>dom</i>, judgement, decree or authority; and <i>dey</i>, a
law or rule.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" title="It iz singular that the last syllable of this word domesday, should hav been mistaken for day, a portion of time; for the latter in Saxon waz written daeg and daegum, az in the Saxon version of the Gospels; whereaz the termination of domesday waz formerly, and ought now to be, spelt dey." class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Or <i>domes</i>, in the plural, may signify
<i>judges</i>. The name of the book then will signify, ether
<i>the rules of judging</i>, or <i>deciding</i>, in questions relating
to the real property of England; or what is more probable,
<i>the rules and determinations of the judges</i> who surveyed
the lands in the kingdom.</p>

<p>That <i>dom</i> had the signification here explained iz capable
of proof. The homager's oath, in the black book
of Hereford, fol. 46, ends thus, "So helpe me God at
<span class="pb" id="Pg251">[pg 251]</span>
his holy <i>dome</i> (judgement) and by my trowthe," (troth,
that is truth.)<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" title="Cowel, Law Dict. dome." class="fnanchor">[71]</a> This explanation coincides with the
meening of the same syllable in other languages, and
confirms the hypothesis of the common origin of the
languages of Europe, laid down in the Notes to my
Dissertations on the English Tung. We see the syllable
in the Greek Î´Î±Î¼Î±Ï, the Latin <i>dominus</i>, (domo)
and in the English word <i>tame</i>; az also in <i>doom</i>, <i>deem</i>,
king <i>dom</i>.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" title="In some words dom is substituted for the ancient termination rick; and in one sense, it iz equivalent to rick, which implies jurisdiction or power. King rick waz used az late az Queen Elizabeth: Bishop-rick iz stil used, denoting the territory or jurisdiction of a bishop." class="fnanchor">[72]</a> In all theze words we observe one primitiv
and several derivativ significations. Its primitiv
sense is that of power or authority, az in Greek and
Latin. In English, it stands for jurisdiction, a judge,
or a sentence. In <i>deem</i>, it denotes the act of the mind
in judging, or forming its determinations.</p>

<p>The other syllable <i>dey</i> iz probably the same word az
<i>ley</i>, law, with a different prepositiv article; for etymologists
tel us, that the radical syllable waz often found
in the muther tung <i>ey</i>. Cowel informs us it waz not
<i>day</i>, but <i>dey</i>; and another author writes it <i>d'ey</i>. The
word <i>daysman</i>, or az it ought to be spelt <i>deysman</i>, stil
used both in England and America, is composed of
<i>dey</i> and <i>man</i>, and signifies an arbitrator or judge, appointed
to reconcile differences. In this country I hav
often heerd it applied to our Savior, az mediator between
God and man.</p>

<p>The ancient lawyers translate the Saxon <i>dom bec</i> and
<i>domesdey</i> by <i>liber judicialis</i>; words which seem not to
convey the ful meening of the original. I should
translate them, <i>liber judicum</i>, the Judges book; or <i>lex
judicum</i>, the Judges law or rule.</p>

<p>The old Saxon word <i>ley</i>, before mentioned, waz, in
different dialects, or at different periods, written <i>ley</i>,
<i>lah</i>, <i>lage</i>, <i>laga</i>. It iz doubtless from the same root az
the Latin <i>lex</i>, <i>lege</i>; and it is remarkable, that the same
word anciently signified <i>peeple</i>; and from this are derived

<i>lay</i> and <i>laity</i>, the peeple as opposed to the <i>clergy</i>.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" title="Johnson derives from the Greek laos; as he does all other words which hav some resemblance to Greek words in sound or signification. I beleev the Saxon or Gothic original and the Greek may be the same, and of equal antiquity." class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
It iz probable that the primitiv sense of the word, in
remote antiquity, waz <i>people</i>; and az the peeple made
the laws in general assembly, so their orders or decrees
came to be called by the same name. This conjecture
iz not groundless, and is no trifling proof of the ancient
freedom of our Gothic ancestors. Tacitus says expressly
of the Germans, "De minoribus rebus principes
consultant; de majoribus <i>omnes</i>." De Mor
Germ. 11. The princes deliberate upon small matters,
or perhaps decide private controverses of small
moment; but laws of general concern are enacted in
an assembly of all the peeple.</p>

<p>The origin of <i>Parishes</i> haz puzzled all the lawyers
and antiquaries of the English nation. Johnson, after
his usual manner, recurs to the Greek, and derives the
word from ÏÎ±ÏÎ¿Î¹ÎºÎ¹Î±, accolarum conventus, an assemblage
or collection of peeple in a naborhood. Others
content themselves with deriving it from the Latin <i>parochia</i>
or French <i>paroisse</i>. These etymologies do not
satisfy me. It is improbable that our ancestors went
to the Greek for names of places or divisions of territory,
that existed in England az erly az the Heptarchy;
especially az the Greek word before mentioned waz
never used in the sense of <i>parish</i>. <i>Parochia</i> cannot be
the origin of parish; for it waz not a Roman word;
on the other hand, it is merely a Gothic or Saxon
word latinized by the erly writers on law; and to derive
<i>parish</i> from the French <i>paroisse</i> is trifling; for we
might as well derive <i>paroisse</i> from <i>parish</i>, which iz at
leest az ancient.</p>

<p>"It iz uncertain at what time England waz divided
into parishes," say most of the law writers. Camden,
in hiz Britannia, page 104, says, the kingdom waz
first divided into parishes by Honorius, archbishop of
Canterbury, in 636. This opinion iz controverted.
<span class="pb" id="Pg253">[pg 253]</span>
Sir Henry Hobart thinks parishes were erected by the
council of Lateran, in 1179. Selden, followed by
Blackstone, supposes both to be rong, and shows that
the clergy lived in common, without any distinction
of parishes, long after the time mentioned by Camden;
and it appeers by the Saxon laws, that parishes were
known long before the council of Lateran.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" title="Blackstone Com. vol. I. 112." class="fnanchor">[74]</a> </p>

<p>The truth probably iz, the kingdom was not divided
into parishes at any one time, but the original ecclesiastical
division grew, in a great measure, out of a prior
civil division. <i>Parish</i> iz the most ancient division of
the ecclesiastical state, and originally denoted the <i>jurisdiction
of a bishop</i>, or what iz now called a <i>diocese</i>.
For this opinion, we hav the authority of the Saxon
laws and charters. "Ego Cealwulfus, dei gratia rex
Merciorum, rogatus a Werfritho, Episcopo Hwicciorum,
istam libertatem donavi, ut <i>tota parochia Hwicciorum</i>
a pastu equorum, regis et eorum qui eos ducunt,
libera sit, &amp;c." Charta Cealwulfi regis, Anno 872.
"Episcopus, congregatis omnibus clericis totius <i>parochiÃ¦</i>,
&amp;c." in a passage quoted by Cowel tit. <i>parish</i>.
Here the <i>bishoprick</i> iz explicitly called a <i>parish</i>, parochia;
and Blackstone remarks, "it is agreed on all hands,
that in the erly ages of christianity in this island, parishes
were unknown, or at leest signified the same az a
<i>diocese</i> does now." Com. Vol. I. 112.</p>

<p>This, being a settled point, wil perhaps furnish a clue
by which we may find the true origin of the word and
of the division.</p>

<p>It iz certain that there waz an ancient word among
the Gothic nations, and probably among the Celtic,
which signified originally <i>a man</i>, afterwards a freeman,
or landholder, in opposition to that class of men who
had no real property. This word waz spelt by the
Romans <i>vir</i>, and signified <i>a man</i>, by way of eminence,
az distinguished from <i>homo</i>; az also a husband or householder.
It answered to the Î±Î½Î·Ï of the Greeks, az distinguished
from Î±Î½Î¸ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¿Ï, a word denoting the human
race in general. The same word in the Gothic or ancient
<span class="pb" id="Pg254">[pg 254]</span>
German waz spelt <i>bar</i>;<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" title="Camden's Britannia. Baron." class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and probably in some
dialects <i>par</i>, for the convertibility of <i>b</i> with <i>p</i> iz obvious
to every etymologist.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" title="Let no one question the probability of such changes of consonants which are formed by the same organs; for to this day b and v are often used promiscuously. In the Spanish language, we are at liberty to pronounce, b az v, or v az b; and with us, marble is often pronounced marvle. It is also certain that the Roman vir is found in the word mentioned by Cesar. Com. 11. 19. Vergo bretus, an annual magistrate among the Ãdui, a nation of Germany...." class="fnanchor">[76]</a> In the Erse language, az
Mc Pherson testifies, <i>bar</i> signifies a man. The word
iz also pronounced <i>fer</i> or <i>fear</i>, which approaches nearer
to the Latin <i>vir</i>: <i>Fergus</i> or <i>Ferguth</i> signifies a <i>man of
word</i> or command. In modern Welsh, which iz the
purest relict of the old Celtic, <i>bar</i> is a son, and <i>barn</i> a
judge. In the ancient Irish, <i>brehon</i> or <i>barhon</i>, which iz
merely <i>baron</i> with an aspirate, signified a judge. See
Lhuyd, Mc Pherson, Ossian, p. 4. and Blackstone's
Commentaries, Vol. I.</p>

<p>This word iz the root of the modern word <i>baron</i>;
for in ancient manuscripts, it iz sometimes spelt <i>viron</i>,
denoting its <i>derivation</i> from <i>vir</i>. For this we hav the
authority of Camden and Du Cange under the word
<i>baron</i>.</p>

<p>So far we tred on sure ground. That theze words
hav existed or do stil exist in the sense above explained,
wil not be denied; and it iz almost certain that they all
had a common origin.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg255">[pg 255]</span>
The word <i>Baron</i> iz evidently derived from the German
<i>bar</i> or <i>par</i>, and under the feudal system, came to
signify the proprietors of large tracts of land, or thoze
vassals of the Lord Paramount, who held lands by honorable
service.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" title="The feudal system iz commonly supposed to hav originated in the conquest of the Roman empire by the northern nations. The rudiments of it however may be discovered az erly az the Cimbric invasion of Italy, a century before the Christian era. Se Florus. lib. 3. c. 3. The Cimbri and Teutones were tribes of the same northern race, az the Germans and Saxons." class="fnanchor">[77]</a> </p>

<p>I shall hereafter attempt to proov that several modern
words are derived from the same root; at present I
confine my remarks to the word <i>parish</i>, which, I conjecture,
iz a compound of <i>par</i>, a landholder, and <i>rick</i>
or <i>rich</i>, which haz been explained, az denoting territory
or jurisdiction: <i>Parick</i> or <i>parich</i>, the jurisdiction of
a par or baron. It iz true the words <i>baron</i> and <i>parliament</i>
seem not to hav been used among the Saxons before
the conquest; but they were used by most of the
nations of the same original, on the continent; az in
Germany, Burgundy, Sweden and Normandy: And
the use of the word <i>parochia</i> in England, before the
conquest, or at leest by the first lawyers and translators
of the Saxon laws, iz to me the strongest proof that
some such word az <i>parick</i> existed among the erly Saxons,
or which waz latinized by thoze writers. Even
if we suppose the word borrowed from nations on the
continent, my supposition of the existence of such a
word iz equally wel founded, for they all spoke dialects
of the same tung.</p>

<p>The first knowlege we hav of the word <i>parish</i> or rather
<i>parochia</i>, iz in the Saxon laws, copied and translated
into Latin by thoze erly writers, Bracton, Britlon,
Fleta, or others of an erlier date. In that erly period,
<i>parochia</i> waz a <i>diocese</i> or <i>bishoprick</i>.</p>

<p>I suspect the jurisdiction of the bishop waz originally
limited by an erldom, county shire, or territory of a
great lord. This waz probably the general division;
for sometimes a clergyman or bishop, in the zerude ages,
<span class="pb" id="Pg256">[pg 256]</span>
had cure of souls in two or more adjoining lordships;
and it often happened that a lord had much waste land
on hiz demesne, which waz not comprehended in the
original <i>parish</i>, and thus came, in later times, to be
called <i>extraparochial</i>. But whatever particular exceptions
there might be, the remark az a general one, will
hold true, with respect to the original jurisdiction of a
bishop.</p>

<p>The number of counties in England iz at present
forty, and that of the dioceses, twenty four; but the
number of counties haz been different at different
times; and some changes, both in the civil and ecclesiastical
state, hav doubtless, in a course of a thousand
years, destroyed the primitiv division. It iz however
some proof of my hypothesis, that most of the bishops
in England are stil called by the names of counties, or
of cities which are shires of themselves; az the bishop
of Durham, of Worcester, of London, of Norwich, &amp;c.
or by the names of the cheef towns in counties; az
bishop of Winchester, of Chichester, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Selden's account of the ancient divisions of the kingdom,
confirms this opinion. See Bacon's Selden, ch.
11. The province or jurisdiction of an archbishop,
waz prior to the origin of diocesses or parishes. Selden
haz given an account of a division of diocesses by archbishop
Theodore in the seventh century; by which it
appears, that in some instances, a diocese or parish waz
one shire or county; and in others, a parochia covered
two, three, or more shires: But in almost every instance,
the limits of a parish were the limits of a shire
or shires. And however strange the reader may think
it, the word <i>church</i> and <i>shire</i> are radically the same.
The Saxon word waz <i>cyrick</i> or <i>cyrk</i>;<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" title="So it iz spelt in the Saxon laws; but its root waz probably circe, from sciran, to divide. C before i and e was in Saxon pronounced ch or neerly; hence circe is chirche." class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and the Scotch
pronounce and write it <i>kirk</i>. It iz, like <i>shire</i>, derived
from the Saxon <i>Sciran</i>, cir, or <i>seyre</i>, to divide. The
church or kirk waz the ecclesiastical division, answering
to shire, and come to signify the jurisdiction of the cathedral
<span class="pb" id="Pg257">[pg 257]</span>
church; the primaria ecclesia or mother church;
and hence the Saxon term <i>cyrick sceate</i>, church scot or
fees, paid by the whole diocese.</p>

<p>In later times, the original <i>parochia</i> or diocese was
divided or extended by the <i>Mickle-mote</i>, <i>Witenagemote</i>
or national assembly, by advice of the bishops, nobles,
and cheef men.</p>

<p>From all I can collect respecting this subject, it appeers
probable, that on the first conversion of the Saxons
to christianity, each <i>earle</i>, <i>earlederman</i>, or erl, whoze
manor or jurisdiction waz the origin of a county, had
hiz clergyman or chaplain to perform divine service.
Hiz residence waz probably in the vicinity of the erl;
and this waz the origin of the <i>cathedral</i>, or mother
church, <i>primaria ecclesia</i>, to which the tenants of
the whole district or erldom afterwards paid tithes.
On the first establishment of theze churches, the
tenants paid tithes where they choze; but fraud or
delay on the part of the tenant, and the encreasing
power of the clergy, occasioned a law of king Edgar,
about the year 970, commanding all the tithes to be
paid to the mother church, to which the parish belonged.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" title="Blackstone Com. vol. I, 112. That each shire had its bishop, seems to be obvious from a law of Edgar, c. 5, where, respecting the county court, it iz ordered, 'celeberrimo huic conventui episcopus et aldermannus intersunto;' not unus episcoporum, but the bishop and erl." class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
This must hav augmented the welth of the
cathedral churches, and given them a superior rank in
the ecclesiastical state.</p>

<p>Previous, however, to this period, the <i>thanes</i> or inferior
lords, had their chaplains and private chapels; and
it waz a rule, that if such chapel had a consecrated
cemetery or burying ground belonging to it, the lord
might appropriate one third of the tithes to the support
of hiz private chaplain. The clerks or bishops who
belonged to the cathedral churches, and were the officiating
ministers of the erls or princes, at that time
the first ranks of noblemen, acquired an influence in
<span class="pb" id="Pg258">[pg 258]</span>
proportion to their property and the extent of their
jurisdictions. Hence the powers of modern bishops
in superintending the clergy of their dioceses. In later
times, they acquired large tracts of land, ether by purchase,
gift or devise, and in right of their <i>baronies</i> gained
a seet among the lords of the kingdom in parliament.</p>

<p>The inferior clergy were multiplied in proportion az
the peeple wanted or could support them, and the jurisdiction
of an earl's chaplain, being limited originally
by his cure of souls, and being founded on a <i>parrick</i> or
territory of a lord, afterwards gave name to all the jurisdictions
of the inferior clergy. Hence the name of
<i>parish</i>, as denoting the extent of a parson's<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" title="Parson iz said, by Coke and others, to be derived from persona, because this officer represents the corporation or church, vicem seu personam ecclesiÃ¦ gerere. This reezon seems to be obscure and unsatisfactory. It iz possible the word may proceed from the same root az parish, viz. par." class="fnanchor">[80]</a> ecclesiastical
authority.</p>

<p>The jurisdiction of a bishop lost the name of parish,
parochia, at a very erly period; but stil the subordinate
divisions of the ecclesiastical state continued to be
regulated by prior civil divisions. For this assertion,
we hav an indisputable authority, which confirms my
opinion respecting the origin of parishes. "It seems
pretty clear and certain," says the learned and elegant
Blackstone, Com. vol. I, 114, "that the boundaries of
<i>parishes</i> were originally ascertained by thoze of a <i>manor</i>
or <i>manors</i>; since it very seldom happens that a manor
extends itself over more parishes than one, tho there
are often many manors in one parish." This iz the
present state of facts, for originally the parish, like the
modern diocese, covered many manors, or estates of
the inferior feudatories.</p>

<p><i>Parliament</i> iz said to be derived from the French,
<i>parlement</i>, which iz composed of <i>parler</i>, to speak, and
<i>ment</i> or <i>mens</i>, mind. Cowel tit. <i>Parliament</i>.</p>

<p>"Parliament," says Johnson, "parliamentuns, law
Latin; parlement, French." Dict. fol. Edit.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg259">[pg 259]</span>
"It is called parliament," says Coke Litt. p. 110.
Ed. Lond. 1778, "because every member of that
court should sincerely and discretely <i>parler le ment</i>,"
(speek hiz mind) "for the general good of the commonwelth;
which name it also hath in Scotland; and
this name before the conquest waz uzed in the time of
Edward the Confessor, William the Conqueror, &amp;c.
It waz anciently, before the conquest, called <i>michel-sinath</i>,<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" title="Great synod--great meeting" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
<i>michel-gemote</i>; <i>ealla</i>, <i>witena-gemote</i>; that is to
say, the great court or meeting of the king and all the
wisemen; sometimes of the king, with the counsel of
hiz bishops, nobles and wisest of hiz peeple. This
court, the French men call <i>les estates</i>; or <i>l'assemble des
estates</i>. In Germany it is called a diet. For thoze
other courts in France that are called <i>parliaments</i>, they
are but ordinary courts of justice, and az Paulus Jovius
affirmeth, were first established with us."</p>

<p>The late editor of Cokes Institutes, remarks, in a
note on this passage, that the latter part of this etymology
iz justly exploded, and apologizes for hiz author
by saying, "it iz to be found in preceding authors of
eminence." He discards the <i>ment</i>, and considers it,
not az an essential, but an adventitious part of the
word; deeming it sufficient to derive the word from
<i>parler</i>, to speak. This opinion he receives from Lambard.</p>

<p>Such a definition, with great deference to theze
venerable authorities, iz a disgrace to etymology. Coke
waz a great lawyer, and Johnson a good Latin and
Greek scholar; but neether of them waz versed in the
Teutonic language and institutions, where alone we
should look for the origin of our laws and the English
constitution. Johnson indeed waz a mere compiler of
other mens etymologies, and Cowel, Selden, Junius
and others from whom he copied, tho deeply lerned,
sometimes fell into very whimsical mistakes. I am
bold to assert that the English derivation of <i>parliament</i>,
or <i>parlement</i> from the French <i>parler</i>, haz no better authority
<span class="pb" id="Pg260">[pg 260]</span>
than a mere whim or notion of theze writers.
We might az well derive <i>parler</i> from <i>parliament</i>, and
both from a <i>parcel</i> of gossips, because they are loquacious.</p>

<p>The true etymology of the word iz <i>par</i>, or <i>bar</i>, a
landholder or baron, and <i>le mote</i>, the meeting. I say
<i>mote</i>, for this waz the Saxon spelling of the word, after
the prepositiv <i>ge</i> waz dropped. It waz originally <i>gemote</i>,
az in <i>witena-gemote</i>; afterwards the <i>ge</i> waz disused,
az in <i>falk-mote</i>. What the original French orthography
waz, I am not certain; but the word came to
England from France, and we find the French article
prefixed, <i>par-le-ment; a meeting of the barons</i>. The
same sound waz used in Germany, Burgundy, and other
parts of Europe, and in all, it had the same meening,
which it, in some mesure, retains in France to this day.</p>

<p>The <i>commune concilium</i> of England, before the conquest,
consisted of the <i>witena</i>, or wise men. It retained
the name of <i>witena-gemote</i>, til after the Norman invasion.
It iz perhaps impossible, at this distance of time,
to ascertain exactly the manner of summoning this national
assembly, or whether the commons or lesser nobility
were entitled to a seet. In old charters, the king
iz said to hav passed laws by advice of the archbishops,
bishops, abbots, erls and wise men of the relm; seniorum
sapientium populi. But we are not able to determin
whether theze seniores sapientes were admitted on account
of their age and wisdom; or whether possession
of real estate waz a requisit qualification. So much iz
certain, that in France and Germany, where we first
heer of <i>parliaments</i>, all the <i>barons</i>, that iz, all the nobility,
were entitled to a seet in the national council, in
right of their baronys; and this iz asserted to hav been
the case in England.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" title="Stuarts English Constitution, p. 275." class="fnanchor">[82]</a> This fact, so well attested in
history az to be undeniable, ought long ago to hav led
the critical enquirer to the true origin of the French
word, parlement. The name of parliament took its
rise under the feudal system, when the assembly of men,
so called, consisted solely of barons or bars. It iz from
<span class="pb" id="Pg261">[pg 261]</span>
this circumstance that the provincial assemblies of
France are properly denominated <i>parliaments</i>. The
erly Norman princes, who introduced the name into
England, summoned none to their council but the clergy
and nobility, and sometimes a few only of the greater
barons. The house of lords iz strictly a <i>parliament</i>,
according to the original of the word, altho since the
commons hav made a part of the legislature, the name
iz extended to the whole body.</p>

<p>The word <i>peer</i> iz said to be derived from the Latin
<i>par</i> equal; and this circumstance haz been the occasion
of innumerable encomiums on the English <i>trial by
peers</i>. So far az equality in the condition of judges and
parties, iz an excellence in any judicial system, the present
practice of trial by jury iz esteemable among a
free peeple; for whatever may be the origin of the word
<i>peer</i>, a trial by men of the naborhood may often proov
a capital security against a court devoted to party. But
it iz at least doubtful whether <i>peers</i>, az used for jurors,
came from the Latin <i>par</i>; for it iz almost certain that
the word <i>peer</i>, az used for nobles, iz derived from the
German <i>par</i>, a landholder, and this iz undoubtedly the
tru primitiv sense of the word. That there waz such a
word in ancient Germany, iz unquestionable; and <i>paramount</i>,
which signifies the lord of highest rank, iz from
the same root; <i>par-amount</i>, the <i>par</i> or <i>baron above</i> the
rest. The jurists on the continent latinized the word,
calling the lords <i>pares</i>; and this, in later ages, waz
mistaken for the plural of the Latin <i>par</i>.</p>

<p>Az the pares or barons claimed almost exclusiv jurisdiction
over their manors, and held courts of justice,
ether in person or by their bailiffs, they came to be considered
az the supreme judges in the last resort of all
civil and criminal causes. <i>Pares</i> or <i>barons</i> became equivalent
to <i>judges</i>. Hence the <i>house of peers</i> in England
iz the supreme judicatory of the nation. Hence
the <i>parliaments</i> (meetings of peers) in France are supreme
courts of justice.</p>

<p><i>Twelv</i> waz a favorit number with our Saxon ancestors,
and the king, or lord paramount, with twelv
<span class="pb" id="Pg262">[pg 262]</span>
judges, constituted the supreme court or council among
the ancient Germans. It will hardly be considered a
digression to examin this institution with more attention;
for if I mistake not, the rudiments of it are visible
az far back az the Christian era; or even az the
Gothic migrations to the west and north of Europe.</p>

<p>In the Edda, or system of Gothic mythology, compiled
by Snorro Sturleson, supreme judge of Iceland,
about the year 1220, we may discern the principles
which would naturally giv rise to the practice of trial
by <i>twelv men</i>. The Edda will indeed be said to be a
collection of fables. To this I answer, fable iz generally,
perhaps always, founded on fact; whatever additions
may be made in a course of time by imperfect tradition.
The Edda iz acknowledged to contain an authentic
account of the opinions of the northern nations
at the time it waz written. This iz all I ask.</p>

<p>Snorro, and TorfÃ¦us the historian of the north, inform
us that even in Scythia, "Odin, the supreme god
of the Goths, performed the functions of cheef preest,
assisted by <i>twelv pontiffs, who distributed justice</i>."<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" title="Mallets North. Antiq. Vol. I. 61. The northern nations had, like the Greeks, twelv principal deities, and this article in their religious beleef might originate the institution of twelv preests, twelv judges, &amp;c. Many civil institutions among rude nations, may be traced to their religious opinions; and perhaps the preference given to the number twelv, in Germany, in Greece, and in Judea, had its origin in some circumstances az ancient az the race of the Jews...." class="fnanchor">[83]</a> </p>

<p>Let us attend to a fact confirming the account. Mallet,
a historian of credit, testifies that the hall or seet of
justice, <ins class="corr" title="my" id="C262">may</ins> be stil seen in different parts of Sweden and
Denmark. "Theze monuments, whoze rude bulk
haz preserved them from the ravages of time, are only
<span class="pb" id="Pg263">[pg 263]</span>
vast unhewn stones, commonly <i>twelv</i> in number, set
upright, and placed in form of a circle. In the middle
iz a stone, much larger than the rest, on which they
made a seet for their king. The other stones served az
a barrier to keep off the populace, and marked the
place of thoze whom the peeple had appointed to make
the election (of king.) They treeted also in the same
place of the most important affairs."<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" title="North. Antiq. Vol. I. 169." class="fnanchor">[84]</a> There iz one
neer Lunden,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" title="London, in England, probably had its name from this place." class="fnanchor">[85]</a> in Scania, another at Leyra, in Zealand,
and a third neer Viburg, in Jutland.</p>

<p>This being a well attested fact, we are disposed to
beleev what iz related in the Edda, Fable 7th, where
it iz asked, "what the universal father <ins class="err" title="do" id="E263">did</ins> when he
bilt Asgard, (the divine abode.") It iz answered, agreeable
to the receeved opinion of the Goths, "he
in the beginning established governors, and ordered
there to decide whatever differences should arize among
men, and to regulate the government in the plain, called
Ida, wherein are <i>twelv</i> seets for themselves, besides
the throne which iz occupied by the universal father."<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" title="North. Antiq. Vol. II. 41." class="fnanchor">[86]</a> </p>

<p>On this passage, the translator of Mallets History
haz the following note. "Theze judges were twelv
in number. Waz this owing to there being twelv
primary deities among the Gothic nations, az there
were among the Greeks and Romans? This I shall
not take upon me to decide; but I think one may
plainly observe here the first traces of a custom, which
hath extended itself to a great many other things.
Odin, the conqueror of the north, established a supreme
court in Sweden, composed of twelv members, to assist
him in the functions of the preesthood and government.
This doubtless gave rise to what waz afterwards
called the senate. And the same establishment
in like manner took place in Denmark, Norway, and
other northern States. Theze senators decided in this
last appeal, all differences of importance; they were, if
I may say so, the assessors of the prince; and were in
<span class="pb" id="Pg264">[pg 264]</span>
number twelv, az we are expressly informed by Saxo,
in hiz life of king Regner Lodbrog. Nor are other
monuments wanting, which abundantly confirm this
truth. We find in Zealand, in Sweden, neer Upsal,
and if I am not mistaken, in the county of Cornwal,
large stones, to the number of twelv, ranged in the form
of a circle, and in the midst of them, one of a superior
height. Such in thoze rude ages, waz the hall of audience;
the stones that formed the circumference,
were the seets of the senators; that in the middle, the
throne of the king. The like monuments are found
also in Persia, neer Tauris. Travellers frequently meet
there with large circles of hewn stones; and the tradition
of the country reports, that theze are the places
where the <i>caous</i> or giants formerly held their councils.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" title="See Chardin's Travels, Vol. III." class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
I think one may discover vestiges of this ancient custom,
in the fable of the <i>twelv peers</i> of France, and in
the establishment of twelv jurymen in England, who
are the <i>proper judges</i>, according to the ancient laws of
that country."</p>

<p>It iz certain that some outlines of this mode of deciding
controversies by <i>twelv</i>, may be seen in the customs
of the Cimbri and Teutones, long before the
Christian era. But I cannot find that the idea of <i>equality</i>
ever entered into the original institution. On the
other hand, every old authority that I hav consulted
confirms me in the opinion, that the <i>twelv men</i> were
chosen from among the landholders or better classes of
peeple; that they were the <i>judges</i> of the court, and
that the distinction between judges and jury, law
and fact, iz a refinement or improovment on the original
constitution, and comparativly of modern date.</p>

<p>It iz certain that a difference of rank existed among
the Germans in the time of Tacitus. "Reges ex nobilitate,
duces ex virtute sumunt."<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" title="Tac. de Mor. Germ. c. 7." class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The same writer
expressly declares, that matters of inferior concern and
private justice came within the jurisdiction of their
<i>princes</i>. "De minoribus rebus principes consultant, de
<span class="pb" id="Pg265">[pg 265]</span>
majoribus, omnes."<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" title="Tac. de Mor. Germ. c. 11." class="fnanchor">[89]</a> In another passage, he is more
explicit: "Principes jura per pagos vicosque reddunt."<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" title="C. 12." class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
Cesar iz still more explicit: "Principes
regionum atque pagorum inter suos jus dicunt, controversiasque
minuunt."<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" title="De Bello Gallico. lib. VI. c. 21." class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Theze <i>principes regionum atque
pagorum</i>, Blackstone says, we may fairly constur to be
lords of hundreds and manors;<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" title="Com. Vol. III. 35. This cannot be strictly true; for the principes were electiv; and therefore could not hav owned the land (pagus) or exercised the office of judge in right of their property. The kings, princes, and generals of the ancient Germans were elected; some for their nobility, that iz, the respectability of their families, arising from the valor and merits of their ancestors; others, az their duces, military commanders, were chosen for their virtues, their personal bravery...." class="fnanchor">[92]</a> they were originally
electiv, az we are informed by Tacitus, "eliguntur in
conciliis principis," and each had a hundred comites,
or assistant judges, who were chosen from among the
peeple. "Centeni singulis, explebe comites, concilium
simul et auctoritas, adsunt."<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" title="De Mor. Germ. c. 13." class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Theze hundred assistants,
or companions, were chosen <i>ex plebe</i>; but when
chosen formed the <i>concilium principis</i>. The prince
waz their president, chosen by themselves, <i>eliguntur in
conciliis principes</i>, and had <i>auctoritatem</i>, authority or jurisdiction
in the town or district.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg266">[pg 266]</span>
The idea of equality iz no where suggested; on the
contrary; the hundredors when chosen became a court
or legislature in the district, competent to the general
purposes of government. No mention iz made of a
distinction between the legislativ and judicial departments;
on the other hand, we may safely conclude,
from the passeges of Cesar and Tacitus before quoted,
that the powers of making laws and deciding causes
were vested in the same men. Cesar says, "nullus est
in pace communis magistratus," nor could the Germans,
in their primitiv simple mode of living, need
such a magistrate. The princes <i>jus dicunt, controversiasque
minuunt</i>, distributed justice, by the assistance of
their <i>comites</i>, and according to the circumstances of the
peeple.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" title="The practice of choosing assistant judges in the Roman commonwealth, waz something similar to our mode of impannelling a jury. Theze assistants were sometimes a hundred, and it iz not improbable, the Roman and German customs of electing that number might be derived from the same original." class="fnanchor">[94]</a> This at leest waz the case with respect to
matters of small magnitude.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg267">[pg 267]</span>
The number of <i>comites principis</i>, or assistants, waz
originally a <i>hundred</i>. This gave name to the district
which they governed, and which afterwards consisted
of any indefinit number, still retaining the primitiv
name. In later ages, the number of assistant judges
waz reduced; a grand jury still consists of twenty four;
a petit jury commonly consists of twelv, but on certain
occasions, and by the custom of particular places in
England, may be composed of sixteen, eight or six.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" title="See Coke Litt. and Hargraves notes on this subject." class="fnanchor">[95]</a> </p>

<p>Such waz the constitution of the ancient Germans,
in which we may discover the principles of the system
which they every where established, after their conquests
in Gaul, Spain, Italy and Britain.</p>

<p><i>Twelv</i> waz a favorit number, not only with the
Saxons, but with all the nations of northern original.
They had twelv principal deities; they numbered the
units up to <i>twelv</i>, instead of stopping at ten, like other
nations;<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" title="Mallets North. Antiquities." class="fnanchor">[96]</a> they had twelv judges to assist their kings or
princes; their hall for the election of their kings consisted
of twelv huge stones, placed in a circle. Hence
we discover the origin of the twelv senators of Sweden,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" title="Mentioned in the preceding note, copied from Mallet." class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
Denmark and Norway; the twelv counsellors of state
in ancient times; the fable, az it iz called, of the twelv
peers in France; the twelv judges in England, and
<span class="pb" id="Pg268">[pg 268]</span>
the trial by twelv peers or jurors, which waz formerly
common to all the northern nations of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" title="These facts gave rise to Cokes quaint remarks, 'that the law delighteth herself in the number of twelv;' and he adds, 'the number of twelv iz much respected in holy writ; as 12 apostles, 12 stones, 12 tribes, &amp;c.' On juries, fol. 155." class="fnanchor">[98]</a> </p>

<p>On the Gothic establishments in the south and west
of Europe, government took a military complection.
The kings parcelled out the conquered lands
among their generals, called <i>duces</i> or <i>principes</i>, by the
Latin writers; and by the Saxons, <i>heretoga</i>. The
generals of first rank receeved or acquired whole provinces,
az Burgundy, and the principalities of Germany.
Theze territories they distributed among their inferior
officers and <i>comites</i> or retainers, of whom every lord
had great numbers about hiz person. Theze constituted
a secondary, but very numerous class of nobility;
and altho there might be differences of rank and property
among them, they were called by one general appellation.
In England, they were called <i>thanes</i>, from a
word signifying <i>to serve</i>, because they held their lands
by the condition of military service. On the continent,
they were called <i>barons</i>, that is freemen, or tenants
of land, upon condition of rendering certain military
and honorable service to their superior lord, who
waz called lord <i>paramount</i>.</p>

<p>Blackstone remarks, that "a baron's iz the most
general and <i>universal</i> title of nobility; for originally every
one of the peers of superior rank had also a barony
annexed to hiz title."<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" title="Com. Vol. I. 398." class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The origin of this title haz
occasioned great enquiry among antiquaries; but the
difficulty vanishes upon my hypothesis, which derives
the word from <i>bar</i>, a landholder and freeman; for on
the establishment of the feudal tenures, all the lands
were held by a few men; the proprietors were all called
<i>barons</i>, and this accounts for the <i>universality</i> of the title
just mentioned. Thus the bishops, after they had obtained
gifts of large tracts of land or manors, resigned
them to the conqueror, William; accepted them again
<span class="pb" id="Pg269">[pg 269]</span>
subject to the conditions of lay fees, claimed rank with
the nobility, and took their seets in the English house
of lords. Actual possession of a barony waz originally
requisit to constitute a lord of parliament; but the title
iz now granted by the king without the possession.</p>

<p>Blackstone mentions the difficulty of tracing the
word <i>baron</i> to its primitiv sense; but confirms the
foregoing explanation when he says, "the most probable
opinion iz that <i>barons</i> were the same az our <i>lords
of manors</i>."<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" title="Com. Vol. I. 399." class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The name indeed waz not used in England
(so far as can be collected from English writers)
till after the conquest. But it iz certain that the feudal
system, tho not in all its severity, waz established in
England before that period; and degrees of nobility
were cotemporary with the Saxon establishments in the
island. The first class were called in Saxon <i>heretoga</i>,
that iz generals or military commanders. But the
most ancient and perhaps the most important civil title
waz that of <i>earles</i> or <i>ealdormen</i>. Theze erls were called
also in Saxon <i>schiremen</i>, for they exercised supreme jurisdiction
in the <i>shires</i>. After the conquest they were
called by the corresponding Norman title <i>counts</i>, from
<i>comites</i>, because they were the king's companions in
war; and their jurisdiction waz called a <i>county</i>.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" title="I am by no meens certain that this derivation of counts from comites, iz just; it iz at leest az probable az otherwise, that contees may be a Gothic word. But this iz conjecture." class="fnanchor">[101]</a> </p>

<p>Inferior to theze in rank were the Saxon <i>thanes</i>, who
were so called from the Saxon <i>thanian</i> ministrare, because
they were the <i>comites</i> or attendants of the ancient
kings or earls. Theze were numerous, and after the
conquest called by the equivalent continental title, <i>barons</i>.
Of theze there were different ranks, <i>thani majores</i>
or <i>thani regis</i>, who served the king in places of high
importance, and took rank next to the bishops and
abbots. Theze had inferior thanes under them, called
<i>thani minores</i>, who were also <i>lords of manors</i>.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" title="See Cowel on the word thane; and in Domesday, 'thanus, est tenens, qui est caput manerii.'" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The
<span class="pb" id="Pg270">[pg 270]</span>
word <i>peer</i> I suppose to be derived from the same root az
<i>baron</i>, bar or par, and to be equivalent in sense. It iz
cleer to me that <i>landholder</i>, or man by way of eminence,
waz its original meening; and that it iz a proper name
of the ancient nobility, given them az proprietors of
vast tracts of land, and that it had no reference to
<i>equality</i> of rank.</p>

<p>But there are better proofs of this point than that
drawn from this supposed derivation. The true original
signification of the word we hav in the phrases,
<i>house of peers</i>, <i>peers of the relm</i>, <i>peerage</i>. And for this
assertion we hav the best authorities in the language.
Cowel, from whom Johnson and most modern lawyers
have borrowed their definitions of law terms, after explaining
the word <i>peer</i> az denoting jurors, says expressly,
"but this word iz <i>most principally used for thoze that
be of the nobility of the relm and lords of the parliament</i>."
Here the author haz mentioned a well supported fact,
and quotes ancient authorities. But he immediately
leevs fact, and runs into conjecture, az to the reezon of
this appellation, which he deduces from a preconceeved,
but probably erroneous, opinion. "The reezon
whereof iz, that altho there be a distinction of degrees
in our nobility, yet in all public actions they are equal;
az in their votes of parliament, &amp;c." Here the author
takes it for granted that the word <i>peer</i> signifies <i>equal</i>,
and assigns, az a cause of its <i>most principal</i> appropriation
to the nobility, that the men, tho of different ranks,
hav an <i>equal vote</i> in parliament. This a curious reason
indeed! A man must be more credulous than I
am, to beleev this slight circumstance would giv rise to
such a particular appropriation of a name. One would
think that the same reezon would hav given the name
to the clergy in convocation and other ecclesiastical
courts. Yet the learned and candid Blackstone haz
copied the same reezon. "The commonalty, like the
nobility, are divided into several degrees; and, az the
lords, tho different in rank, yet all them are <i>peers</i> in
respect of their nobility; so the commoners, tho some
are greatly superior to others, yet all are in law <i>peers</i>, in
<span class="pb" id="Pg271">[pg 271]</span>
respect of their <i>want</i> of <i>nobility</i>."<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" title="Com. Vol. I. 403. 'But the same author, in page 399, says, the right of peerage seems to hav been originally territorial, that iz, annexed to lands, manors, &amp;c. the proprietors of which were, in right of thoze estates, allowed to be peers of the relm;' that iz, in plain English, certain men, in right of their estates, were allowed to be equals of the relm. This will not pass for reezon and truth on this side of the Atlantic." class="fnanchor">[103]</a> This appeers very
extraordinary, that an <i>equality of suffrage</i> should giv an
appellation in preference to <i>difference of rank</i>, which iz,
so much more obvious and more flattering to the
haughty barons. But if the commoners are <i>peers</i> or
<i>equals in suffrage</i> az well az the lords; that iz, on the
<i>same principle</i>; or as Blackstone states it, if the <i>lords</i> are
<i>peers</i> because they are <i>noble</i>, and the commoners are
<i>peers</i>, because they are <i>not noble</i>, why hav not the commoners
the same appellations of <i>peers of the relm</i>?
The lords are not <i>equally</i> noble, by Blackstone's own
statement, for they are of very different ranks; and the
commons are not equally <i>ignoble</i>, (this word iz used
merely for contrast) for they are of different ranks:
Yet the vote of one commoner iz az good in the house
of commons, az that of another; and the vote of one
lord, in the other house, iz az good az that of another.
If the <i>equality of suffrage</i> iz a proper ground for the title
of <i>peers</i> in one house, the reezon extends to the other.
Yet commoners are not <i>peers of the relm</i>; and until a
good reezon can be assigned for the distinction of titles
between the houses, I shall beleev that the word <i>peer</i>
had originally no reference to <i>equality</i>.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" title="Horne, in hiz Mirror of Justices, chap. I. sect. 2. says, 'altho the king ought not to hav any peer (that iz, equal) in the land, yet because he cannot be a judge in a case where he iz a party, it waz behovefull by the law that he should hav companions to heer and determin of all writs and plaints of all wrongs, &amp;c. Theze companions are now called countees, earles, according to the Latin comites, &amp;c.' This iz singular! The king ought to hav no equal; therefore he ought to hav companions for judges;..." class="fnanchor">[104]</a> </p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg272">[pg 272]</span>
But say the English lawyers and antiquaries, "the
bishops are not in strictness held to be <i>peers of the relm</i>,
but only <i>lords of parliament</i>."<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" title="Blackstone, Vol. I. 157, from Staunford P C. 153." class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Why not? What is
the distinction? Here our authors leev us in the dark;
but perhaps the foregoing clu will leed us to the light.
Bishops were not the original proprietors of baronies;
they were not <i>bars</i> or <i>pars</i>, the hereditary lords of manors,
consequently not <i>peers of the relm</i>. This iz such
an obvious solution of the question, that I am surprized
it should hav been overlooked. Under the papal
hierarchy, the clergy gained vast influence over the
minds of men, and by a variety of expedients, became
possessed of large estates, and some of them, of ancient
baronies. But their acquisitions were comparativly of
modern date, and many of them usurpations, altho in
consequence of their estates they obtained a seet in the
house of lords. They are therefore <i>lords of parliament</i>;
but the ancient peers, priding themselves upon the antiquity
of their families, and claiming certain prescriptiv
rights, would not admit the clergy to an equal share
of authority and honor; for to this day, a vote of the
temporal lords iz good against every vote of the clergy.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" title="It iz now held that e converso, a vote of the spiritual lords, if a majority, iz good against all the temporal lords; but Coke douts it. Supposing this to be admitted, the privilege is modern, and makes nothing against my supposition." class="fnanchor">[106]</a> </p>

<p>"The appellation <i>peer</i>," says Cowel, "seems to be
borrowed from France, and from thoze <i>twelv peers</i>
that Charlemagne instituted in that kingdom." The
same word waz used by other nations. Theze twelv
peers constituted a great council or supreme court, and
the members were all <i>barons</i>, or of the nobility.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" title="It haz been remarked that baron iz the most general title of nobility; indeed every nobleman waz originally a baron. Coke. I. 74. The lords of manors, both in England and on the continent, were the suitors in the king's court, and called pares curtis or curiÃ¦. The lords tenants were called the peers of hiz court baron. See Blackstone, Vol. I. ch. 4." class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Can
the word, applied to the members of this council, signify
<i>equal</i>? By no meens. Here we trace the word
<span class="pb" id="Pg273">[pg 273]</span>
to a remote period of antiquity, and find it used by
the emperor of Germany; or at leest an appellation given
to one of the first councils in hiz dominions. This
iz the pure primitiv sense of the word <i>peers</i>, <i>barons</i>,
that iz, in the full latitude of its signification, all the ancient
nobility; who held lands of him ether immediately
or mediately; who formed hiz supreme judicial court,
and in some countries, hiz legislativ assembly; who
were hereditary councillors of the crown; and cheef
<i>judges</i> of all causes arising on their own manors, except
such az were of great consequence.</p>

<p>This explanation accounts for what Selden has remarked,
chap. 65, that "the barons of England, before
the reign of Edward I, were rather the <i>great</i> and
<i>richer sort</i> of men, than <i>peers</i>, altho they were of the
number." That iz, the Saxon thanes, who were great
landholders, but inferior to the erls, had, after the conquest,
receeved the appellation of <i>barons</i> from the continent;
but, being a secondary class of nobility, had
not claimed or acquired the power and privileges of
the German and French princes and nobles who had
the title of <i>peers</i>, until the Norman kings had introduced,
into the kingdom, the oppressiv and invidious
distinctions of the feudal tenures, in the full extent of
the system.</p>

<p>It will be enquired, if this iz the sense of the word,
how came juries of common freeholders to be called
<i>peers</i>? The answer iz eesy; the jurors were the <i>judges</i>
of the inferior courts, and not merely the equals of
the parties, az iz commonly supposed. The <i>erl</i> or
<i>baron</i>, in strictness; but more commonly, the vice-comes,
sheriff or lords deputy, waz the president or
cheef justice, and the jurors, the <i>assistant judges</i>. For
this opinion, numberless authorities may be produced.
The barons were the assistant judges, <i>peers</i>, in the court
of the lord paramount or king, and thus became judges
by prescription; so the word <i>peer</i> or <i>baron</i>, in time,
became equivalent to <i>judge</i>. Az the nobles were judges
in the kings court, and decided on appeels in the
last resort, so the freeholders who constituted the court
<span class="pb" id="Pg274">[pg 274]</span>
in the county, hundred or manor, came to be denominated
<i>peers</i>, that iz, <i>judges</i>.</p>

<p>Reeve, in hiz history of the English Law, remarks,
that "the administration of justice in the days of
William the conqueror, waz so commonly attendant
on the rank and character of a baron, that <i>baro</i> and
<i>justiciarius</i> were often used <i>synonimously</i>." Blackstone
says, "it iz probable the barons were the same az our
lords of manors, to which the name of court baron
(which iz the lords court, and incident to every manor)
givs some countenance." Vol. I. 398. It iz surprizing,
theze writers should approach so neer the tru original
and meening of the word, <i>baron</i>, and not reech it.</p>

<p>Most writers on the ancient state of government in
Europe, hav remarked that the nobility held the office
of judges. "Les mesmes comtes," says Mezeray,
"et ducs, qui jugeoint les FranÃ§ois, les menoient a
la guerre." tom. I. p. 118. The counts and dukes
were both judges and generals.</p>

<p>"Duo&mdash;comitum munera fure; unum videlicet
justitiÃ¦ populis ministrandÃ¦, alterum militiÃ¦ sibi subjectÃ¦,
quando in bellum eundum erat, educendÃ¦ atque
regendÃ¦." Muratori. Antiq. Ital. tom. I. p. 399.
The counts had two offices or departments of business;
the administration of justice, and command of
the troops in war.</p>

<p>Stuart, in hiz English Constitution, remarks, "that
the erls presided in the courts of law. Their jurisdiction
extended over their feefs: In all causes, civil and
criminal, they judged without appeel, except in cases of
the utmost consequence." Part 3. Sect. 3.</p>

<p>I presume it iz needless to multiply authorities. The
strongest argument in favor of my opinions iz drawn
from the supreme judiciary powers of the house of
lords in England. The lords are <i>peers</i> of the relm;
that iz, the ancient prescriptiv judges or barons, who
claim the privilege by hereditary right or immemorial
usuage. The <i>house of peers</i>, iz literally and in fact, <i>a
house of judges</i>; an assembly of all the ancient judges in
the kingdom. So Selden relates of the Saxons, whom
<span class="pb" id="Pg275">[pg 275]</span>
he supposes to be descended from the same original az
the Greeks, and long prior to the ages of Roman glory;
"their country they divided into counties or circuits,
all under the government of <i>twelv lords</i>, like the Athenian
territory under the <ins class="err" title="Archorites" id="E275">Archontes</ins>. Theze, with the
other <i>princes</i>, had the <i>judicial power of distributiv justice</i>
committed to them, with a hundred commoners out of
each division." Tit. Saxons. The same writer declares,
chap. 58, that the nobles "were in their most
ordinary work, <i>meetings of judges</i>, or <i>courts of judicature</i>;
that the king and hiz barons made many laws and
constitutions which hav obtained the name of statutes,"
(which he supposes may hav been equitable decisions
of new causes, which afterwards had the force of laws)
"that the judges of this supreme court are the <i>baronage</i>
of England; and that the house of lords still retain
their supreme judiciary powers by ancient prescriptiv
right."</p>

<p>In addition to this authority, I would remark that
the modern supreme judiciary of Scotland iz copied almost
exactly from the ancient Saxon trial by laghmen
or thanes. The lords of session, or president and fourteen
judges, are a court of law and fact, without a jury;
and this iz exactly the <i>old</i> trial by <i>peers</i>.</p>

<p>The parliaments in France are justly said by lord
Coke, to be <i>ordinary courts of justice</i>; another striking
evidence of what I hav advanced. The word <i>parliament</i>
came from France, where it denotes that assembly
of barons, which constitutes the supreme <i>court of justice</i>
in each of the several provinces. This iz the original
import of the word, and the parliaments in France still
retain that signification. This name waz introduced
into England, under the Norman princes, and superseded
the Saxon name of the national assembly, <i>witena-gemote</i>.
Indeed, during the depression of the peeple,
under the first princes of the Norman line, when the
military tenures were established with rigor, national
assemblies were called but seldom, and when summoned,
consisted principally of the bishops and peers (barons)
of the relm. They however acquired the name of <i>parliament</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Pg276">[pg 276]</span>
and retain it to this day; altho one branch of
that body iz composed of commoners. The tru meening
of <i>parliament</i> iz a <i>meeting</i> of <i>barons</i> or <i>peers</i>, and their
principal business waz to decide controversies: They
had original jurisdiction over causes in which the nobles
were parties, az men of rank would not seek redress
before an inferior tribunal; and they had an appellate
jurisdiction over other causes in the last resort.
The parliament of England iz a legislativ body; but
the <i>house of lords</i> retains the primitiv privilege of finally
deciding controversies. This branch of the legislature
alone answers to the <i>parliaments</i> in France, which approach
neer the ancient institution.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" title="The Norman princes might well call their councils parliaments, meetings of barons; for they often summoned none but the barons and clergy, and sometimes but a few of the barons. Henry the third, once summoned but twenty five barons of two hundred and fifty, then in the kingdom, and one hundred and fifty of the clergy. Yet this meeting waz a parliament. Selden, chap. 67." class="fnanchor">[108]</a> </p>

<p>So in England, the house of lords, and even the
temporal lords alone, were called formerly a <i>parliament</i>.
Blackstone, b. IV, c. 19, upon the authority of ancient
books and records, repeetedly denominates the house
of peers, when acting az a court of supreme judicature,
a <i>parliament</i>, a <i>full parliament</i>; and the spiritual lords
are not permitted to giv any vote upon <i>gilty</i> or <i>not gilty</i>,
for they are not ancient <i>peers</i> (that iz, barons, prescriptiv
judges) of the relm. It haz been douted whether
the spiritual lords had a right to sit in the house on the
trial of a peer; but by a determination of the lords in
the erl of Danby's case, 1679, they were permitted
"to stay and sit in court in capital cases, till the court
proceeds to the vote of gilty or not gilty." Still they
form no part of the court; the temporal lords constituting
a <i>full parliament</i>, that iz, az I hav explained the
tru primitiv meening of the word, <i>a meeting of barons
or judges</i>.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" title="Thoze who wish to see a more particular account of the extensiv judicial powers of the barons in Europe, may consult Robertson's Charles V. Vol. I. page 49, and note [Z] page 250, where the authorities are referred to." class="fnanchor">[109]</a> </p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg277">[pg 277]</span>
I would just add on this head, that the institution of
<i>twelv judges</i> in England, iz copied from the ancient
mode of trial in Germany. The old <i>Curia Regis</i> consisted
of the king, hiz grand justiciary, the officers of
hiz palace and <i>his barons</i>. This court followed the
kings person wherever he went. Out of this were
formed the several courts now established at Westminster.
But the title of <i>barons of the exchequer</i> and <i>barons</i>
of the cinque ports, who are judges, furnishes an additional
argument in favor of my opinions.</p>

<p>The foregoing explanation of the words, <i>baron</i> and
<i>peer</i>, leeds to a probable account of the <i>trial by peers</i>.
It can be prooved that the jurors were the <i>judges</i> of the
county, hundred and manor courts, and the probability
iz that the suitors in theze courts receeved the appellation
of <i>peers</i>, from the circumstance of their being
landholders. Several authorities seem at leest to favor
this opinion.</p>

<p>"Concerning the institution of this court by the
laws and ordinances of ancient kings, and especially of
Alfred, it appeereth that the first kings of this relm had
all the lands of England in demesne, and les grand
manors et royalties, they reserved to themselves; and
of the remnant, they, for the defence of the relm, enscoffed
the barons of the relm, with such jurisdiction
az the court baron now hath, and instituted the freeholders
to be <i>judges of the court baron</i>."<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" title="Coke Litt. 74. That the freeholders were judges iz tru; but that the barons and freeholders derived their authority from kings, iz wholly a mistake." class="fnanchor">[110]</a> </p>

<p>"The manor courts are of two sorts. The first iz
by the common law, and iz called the court baron, az
some hav said, for that it iz the freeholders or freemens
court, (for <i>barons</i> in one sense signifie <i>freemen</i>) and of
that court the <i>freeholders</i>, being suitors, be <i>judges</i>. The
second iz the copyholders court, which iz called a
court baron, because among the laws of king Edward
the confessor, it iz said: "Barones vero qui suam habent
curiam de suis hominibus," taking the name of
the baron who waz lord of the manor, or for that properly
<span class="pb" id="Pg278">[pg 278]</span>
in the eye of the law, it hath relation to the <i>freeholders
who are judges of this court</i>. And in ancient charters
and records, the <i>barons</i> of London and the cinque
ports do signify the <i>freemen</i> of London and the cinque
ports."<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" title="1. Coke Litt. 73." class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Theze passages are express to my purpose.
Indeed it must hav been that the freeholders, now called
<i>jurors</i>, were judges; for the lord of the manor waz
cheef judge or president merely, and we heer nothing,
at this erly period of Saxon jurisprudence, of a distinction
between law and fact.</p>

<p>Horne, in the Mirror of Justices, asserts<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" title="Cap. I. Sect. III." class="fnanchor">[112]</a> "that by
the constitutions of Alfred, the free tenants in every
county, hundred and manor, were to meet together and
<i>judge their nabors</i>." "Every free tenant hath ordinary
jurisdiction in theze courts." "The lords and tenants
shall incur certain penalties by the <i>judgement of the
suitors</i>." "Theze courts are called county courts,
where the <i>judgement iz by the suitors</i>, if there be no writ,
and iz by warrant of ordinary jurisdiction." That iz,
when there waz no special court held by the justices in
eyre.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" title="He must speak of the state of things after the conquest, otherwise justices in eyre would not hav been mentioned." class="fnanchor">[113]</a> So also in a book called the "Diversity of
Courts," written in Henry the eighth's time, it iz said,
"in the court baron the <i>suitors are the judges</i>, and <i>not</i>
the <i>steward</i>."</p>

<p>Cowel tels us, "the court baron iz more properly
<i>curia baronum</i>, i. e. the court of <i>freeholders</i>, (for so barones
does also signify) over whom the lord of the manor
presides. In this court the <i>freeholders are judges</i>."<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" title="Law Dict. Court baron." class="fnanchor">[114]</a> </p>

<p>Selden's authority confirms this fact. He says,
"neether waz the bishops nor sheriffs work, in the
folk-mote or county court, other than directory or declaratory;
for the <i>freemen</i> were judges of the fact, and
the other did but <i>edocere jura populo</i>."<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" title="Bacon's Selden chap. 24." class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Here a distinction
iz cleerly made beetween the <i>freemen</i> and the <i>populus</i>;
the freemen were the judges, and the bishop or
sheriff edocuit jura, proclaimed the decision to the
<span class="pb" id="Pg279">[pg 279]</span>
multitude. The freemen, or landholders, then were
the <i>peers</i> of the court; they were not the <i>equals</i> of the
multitude, for the <i>populus</i>, the laborers of all descriptions,
were considered az belonging to an inferior class
of men, and had no voice in the folk-mote.</p>

<p>To sum up the whole, we hav the authority of
the correct and judicious Blackstone, who expressly
asserts, book III. chapters IV and V, that in the
court baron, the hundred court and county court,
the freeholders or suitors are <i>the judges</i>, and the steward
in the two former, and the sheriff in the latter, are
<i>the registrars or ministerial officers</i>. Now it iz well
known that before the conquest, theze included <i>all the
courts</i> that were in the kingdom, except the <i>witena-gemote</i>,
in which there waz nothing like a jury, separate
from the members of that council. So that the freeholders
or jurors were not only <i>judges</i>, but they were
the <i>sole judges</i> in all the inferior courts in the kingdom;
and of course there could be little or no distinction
between <i>law</i> and <i>fact</i>. Nay, more, the suitors
were the <i>witnesses</i> also; and the principal reezon for
summoning <i>freeholders of the vicinage</i> waz originally
this; it waz supposed they were acquainted with the
facts in dispute. Hence laws were made to compel
the jurors to <i>tell the truth, if they knew the facts</i>, which
waz always supposed, till the contrary appeered. In
theze courts small causes were decided; and the county
court had cognizance of ecclesiastical causes, az well
az civil, and often determined disputes between the
nobles, about real estates of immense value.</p>

<p>But important matters were generally brought <ins class="corr" title="be-before" id="C279">before</ins>
the <i>witena-gemote</i>, or assembly composed of the
king, bishops, erls and wise men. This waz a national
council, which united in itself all powers, legislativ,
judicial, civil and ecclesiastical, in law and equity. Such
a thing az a jury waz never known in this supreme
court. William the conqueror first separated the civil
from the ecclesiastical authority, and substituted the <i>aula
regiÃ¦</i>, a high court, consisting of hiz cheef officers and
barons, in place of the Saxon <i>witena-gemote</i>. This
court waz the supreme judicature in the nation; a jury
<span class="pb" id="Pg280">[pg 280]</span>
waz no part of it, and it followed the king wherever
he went, till it waz fixed by Magna Charta in Westminster
Hall. Afterwards, in the reigns of Henry III
and Edward I, several courts were carved out of the
<i>Aula Regis</i>; az the common pleas, the court of kings
bench, the exchequer and chancery courts; and it does
not appeer that a jury, distinct from the judges, formed
any part of the important common law courts, till after
this period. The distinction therefore between
judges and jury, law and fact, seems not to hav been
known, till the dissolution of the <i>Aula Regis</i>, at the
cloze of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Let us enquire what kind of men theze freeholders
were, who were summoned az jurors or judges at theze
courts.</p>

<p>Lord Coke iz express, and quotes Glanvil and Bracton
for authorities, that "in ancient times the jurors
were <i>twelv knights</i>," (that iz, probably, persons holding
land amounting to a knights see.)<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" title="Some say this see waz eight hundred akers of land; others, six hundred and eighty, or 20l. a year, which, considering the difference in the value of money, waz equal perhaps to 300l. or 400l. at the present time. Here seems to be a confusion of ancient and modern ideas. The ancient knights see waz a certain tract of land; in later times that see was valued at 20l. in money." class="fnanchor">[116]</a> </p>

<p>Henry III issued writs to the several counties to enquire
into the liberties of hiz subjects, by <i>twelv good and
lawful knights</i>.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" title="Hale's Hist of Com. Law, 154." class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The Saxon laws are more explicit.
"Habeantur placita in singulis wapentachiis, ut exeantur
<i>duodecem thayni</i> et prÃ¦positus cum eis, et jurent super
sanetuarium, quod eis dabitur in manu, quod neminem
innocentem velint accusare, vel noxium concelare."<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" title="L L Ethel. c. 4." class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
Here the law of Ethelred iz explicit in ordaining
a court of twelve <i>thayni</i>, thanes or barons, with
their prÃ¦positus or president, who waz the officer of
the hundred. Cowel remarks on this passage, "that
this may seem to intend the number of <i>judges</i>, and not
of the <i>jury</i>; but the jury themselves, in some cases, are
judges, that iz, they are <i>judges</i> of the <i>fact</i>, and the judge
iz bound to giv sentence according to their verdict."
<span class="pb" id="Pg281">[pg 281]</span>
This writer here supposes the <i>thayni</i> to be really <i>jurors</i>
and <i>judges</i>; but <i>judges</i> only of the <i>fact</i>. This iz <i>the
fundamental error</i> of most lawyers who hav written on
the subject; they take it for granted, that the distinction
of <i>law</i> and <i>fact</i> waz coeval with the trial by twelv freeholders.
Yet a single circumstance, mentioned by
Cowel in the same page, with the passage quoted,
might hav undeceeved him, which iz, that "trial by
jury waz anciently called <i>duodecem virale judicium</i>," the
<i>judgement</i> of twelv men. Their sentence or decision
waz called a <i>judgement</i>; the distinction between the
<i>verdict</i> of a jury, and the <i>judgement</i> of the court, waz
unknown in the erly ages of the Saxons; nor can I
find it mentioned, till after the conquest.</p>

<p>This, and similar passages, hav however occasioned
much dispute among other English lawyers and antiquaries.
They hav adopted the opinion, that a jury
must consist of twelv equal commoners, and cannot explain
what iz ment by summoning <i>twelv thanes</i>.
"Brady and Hicks," says Stuart, "contended that
theze thanes were <i>not jurors</i>, but <i>judges</i> or <i>lawyers</i>.
Coke and Spelman were of a different opinion." The
truth iz, they were both <i>jurors</i> and <i>judges</i>; and a
knowlege of the tru primitiv sense of one little monosyllable
in our language, would hav unravelled the
whole mystery to theze learned enquirers.</p>

<p>The most usual word for jurors, in the Saxon laws,
iz <i>lahmen</i> or <i>lagemen</i>; a word that haz puzzled the
law writers, az it seems to meen something more than
<i>equals</i>; and they hav no idea of any thing in a jury,
but <i>equality</i>. Hicks supposed them to be judges, "duodeni
jure consulti," men versed in law. Spelman
rendered the word, <i>legales homines</i>, good and lawful
men; very inadequate words indeed; but the error
haz been copied times without number, and still prevails.
<i>Lahman</i> iz literally a <i>law man</i>, man of the law,
a judge. Law waz in a rude state, at that period; but
the thanes were both <i>lawyers</i> and <i>judges</i>; <i>jure consulti</i>.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" title="We find by ancient records, that the clergy, before the conquest, were sometimes summoned az jurors or judges in the temporal courts. But the thanes were the most usual judges in the courts baron. The proper Saxon name of this court waz halimate or halmote, hallmeeting; 'Omnis causa terminetur vel hundredo, vel comitatu, vel halimote, socam habentiam, vel dominorum curia.' And in W. Thorn, Anno 1176, the judges of this court are expressly said to be thanes,..." class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Pg282">[pg 282]</span>
Professional distinctions could not be but little known,
amidst an unlettered peeple, who had few positiv laws,
and fewer records and precedents; and the <i>lahmen</i>,
the <i>seniores thani</i>, or <i>meliores viri</i>, az they were called,
were summoned at certain times to decide controversies,
according to law, where a law waz provided; otherwise
according to their discretion. The decisions of
theze <i>lahmen</i> were held in esteem; many of them
were preserved and handed down by tradition, and I
hav no dout, theze, rather than statutes, gave rise to the
general and particular customs, which are called the
common law of England.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" title="'And the sheriffs and bailiffs caused the free tenants of their bailiwicks to meet at the counties and hundreds, at which justice waz so done, that every one so judged hiz nabor by such judgement az a man could not elsewhere receev in the like cases, until such times az the customs of the relm were put in writing, and certainly established.'---- Mirror. chap 1. sect. 3." class="fnanchor">[120]</a> </p>

<p>Coke defines <i>lahman</i> to be one, "habens socam et
sacam super homines suos;" that iz, liberty of holding
a court over hiz tenants: Which explanation he
quotes from Bracton. "Soke,(or soc) significat libertatem
curiÃ¦ tenentium quam <i>socam</i> appellamus."<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" title="Fleta. lib. I. c. 47." class="fnanchor">[121]</a> </p>
<p>
<span class="pb" id="Pg283">[pg 283]</span></p>
<p>This word iz found in domesday and in the laws of
Edward the confessor. Cowel quotes a passage from
an ancient book, where Ulvet, the Son of Forno, iz
called <i>lagaman</i> of the city of York, where, he says, it
doutless signified some cheef officer, az judge or recorder.
Thoze who had <i>socam</i> et <i>sacam</i>, or jurisdiction
over the persons and estates of their tenants, were
the <i>thanes</i> or barons; and this iz agreed by Lambard,
Somner, Coke, Cowel, and most writers on law.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" title="Laghman, to this day, iz the name of a judge or magistrate, both in Sweden and Iceland. In theze countries it retains its primitiv and tru English meening.--Mallets North. Antiq. Vol. I." class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
Lambard, whoze authority iz very respectable, speeks
of a jury thus: "In singulis Centuriis comitia sunto,
atque liberÃ¦ conditionis viri duodeni Ã¦tate superiores
unÃ  cum prÃ¦posito, sacra tenentes juranto, &amp;c." Of
a jury <i>per medietatem <ins class="err" title="leriquÃ¦" id="E283">linguÃ¦</ins></i>, he says, "Viri <ins class="err" title="dacodeni" id="E283a">duodeni</ins>
<i>jure consulti</i>, AngliÃ¦ sex, WalliÃ¦ totidem, Anglis et
Wallis jus dicunto." Fol. 91. 3. Here Lambard
not only describes jurors az men of <i>free condition</i> and
respectable for age, but az <i>jure consulti</i>, the <i>judges</i> of
the court; and <i>jus dicunto</i>; they were men who administered
law and justice. This, it appeers from all
ancient testimonies, waz the uniform practice among
the Saxons. The jurors were twelv <i>thanes</i> or men of
free condition; <i>lahmen</i>, <i>jure consulti</i>, or judges, and
constituted the <i>court</i>; with the prÃ¦positus, or proper
officer of the district, az their president, who sat az the
deputy of the erl, in the county court; the deputy of
the lord of the manor, in the court baron; or az the
cheef magistrate of the hundred. And one source of
error in understanding this ancient institution, haz
been the wrong translation of <i>lahman</i>, by Spelman and
others, who rendered the word, <i>legalis homo</i>; a good
and lawful man. The meening iz not so indefinit az
a <i>lawful man</i>, which could not be redily understood or
explained. Rude nations do not deal in such vague
<span class="pb" id="Pg284">[pg 284]</span>
ideas. The meening iz, <i>man of law</i>, whoze business
it waz to know the law and administer justice.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" title="Selden waz forced to confess the jure consulti and Ã¦tate superiores, so often mentioned in the Saxon laws, az composing the homage or jury of twelv, to hav been cheef men both for experience and knowlege. To such as stumble at this conceet, as he expresses it, he remarks that the work of jurors requires them to be cheef men, az they judge of matter of fact; (a reezon drawn from the modern notions of jurymen's province.)..." class="fnanchor">[123]</a> </p>

<p>But if we suppose the word to meen <i>legalis homo</i>,
and that the only requisit in a juror, iz freedom; or
that he should be <i>liber homo</i>; this would exclude a
vast proportion of the English nation from the privilege.
I know that Magna Charta repeetedly mentions
theze freemen, <i>liberos homines</i>, and secures to them
certain rights, among which iz, trial <i>per pares suos</i>,
which I suppose to hav been originally, <i>by their judges</i>;
altho at this period, the idea of equality in the condition
of judges might hav prevailed: And indeed the
<i>freemen</i> were mostly tried by men of equal rank. I
am sensible also that the modern construction of Magna
Charta extends this privilege to every man in the relm
of England; <i>omnis liber homo</i> iz said to comprehend
every English subject. I rejoice that by the struggles
of a brave peeple, this construction of that compact haz
<span class="pb" id="Pg285">[pg 285]</span>
actually taken effect in a considerable degree. But I
cannot think all the English nation were comprehended
in the words of the instrument; or that the privilege
of <i>trial by peers</i> waz extended, or ment to be extended,
to all the peeple. Magna Charta waz merely
a convention between the king and hiz barons, assembled
at Runing-mead; and the laboring part of the
peeple, debased by servitude under an oppressiv aristocracy,
seem hardly to hav been in the contemplation of
the parties. The villeins, rustics, or tenants at will,
who probably composed a majority of the peeple, had
one privilege indeed secured to them: It waz stipulated
that they should not be deprived, by fine, of their
carts, plows, and other instruments of husbandry;
that iz, they should not be deprived of the meens of
laboring for their masters. Further than this, a large
proportion of the English were not noticed in Magna
<span class="pb" id="Pg286">[pg 286]</span>
Charta, but were considered az a part of their lords
property, and transferable, like moveables, at their plezure.</p>

<p>The <i>freemen</i>, or thoze classes of peeple which came
within the description of <i>liberi homines</i> in that famous
convention, were the nobility and clergy tenants <i>in
capite</i>, or such at most az had a life estate in lands, and
could serve on juries. The lazzi, villeins, or modern
copyholders, were not at that time capable of serving;
they were below the rank of freemen; they had not
the right of trial by peers, even in the common acceptation
of the word; nor were they admitted to the
privilege till the reign of Richard III. Multitudes of
them are not <i>peers</i> of <i>the commons</i>, even on the principle
of equal suffrage, for they hav not the property requisit
to qualify them for the privilege of voting at elections.
Blackstone's assertion therefore, that every subject of the
kingdom haz a right by Magna Charta, to trial by hiz
equals, cannot be tru, for vast numbers of the nations
are not, and never were, entitled to be jurors. But in
the sense I understand and hav explained the word, every
man haz a right to <i>trial by hiz peers</i>; that iz, by
freeholders of the vicinity, who are <i>his judges</i>. The
propriety of calling them <i>hiz judges, pares suos</i>, iz discovered
in the gradation of courts established in England.
The <i>peers of the relm</i>, or barons, were originally
the suitors or judges in the kings court, where alone
the nobility were tried; hence the barons were always
tried by <i>their</i> judges, <i>pares suos</i>. The clergy, the thanes
of the lower class, or other freeholders who had life
estates in lands, were the suitors in the courts of the
counties, the hundreds and manors. Theze were
the <i>judges</i> of theze courts, and called <i>peers</i>. The freemen
might be said to be tried by their <i>equals</i>; but the
villeins were not; yet both were tried by <i>their</i> peers;
that iz, by the peers of theze inferior courts, who were
exclusivly <i>the judges</i>.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" title="'The division of the county waz done by freemen, who are the sole judges thereof.' Selden, Matthew, Paris, and others, testify that the folk-mote, peeple's meeting or county court, waz a county parliament, invested with legislativ or discretionary powers in county matters. In theze small districts, they appeer to hav been competent to decide all controversies, and make all necessary local regulations...." class="fnanchor">[124]</a> </p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg287">[pg 287]</span>
From what haz been advanced on this subject, if we
may rely on substantial authorities, and at leest probable
etymologies, the following conclusions may be
safely deduced. That in ancient Germany, the <i>principes
pagorum et regionum</i>, with a certain number of assistants,
originally a hundred, sometimes twenty four,
but commonly twelv, elected by the peeple, (not <i>pro
re nata</i>, but for a stated period) formed a council
(concilium) for the government of a district: That
in their military expeditions, the <i>duces</i>, or generals, had
their <i>life guards</i>, or comites, who attached themselves
to the person of their cheef, and fought by hiz side:<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" title="'Magnaque et comitum Ã¦mulatio, quibus primus apud principem suum locus; et principum, cui plurimi et acerrimi comites.' The princes kept az many of these retainers in their service in time of peace, az they could support. 'HÃ¦c dignitas, hÃ¦ vires, magno semper electorum juvenum globo circumdari, in pace, decus, in bello, prÃ¦sidium. Ibid.'" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Pg288">[pg 288]</span>
That theze retainers, in some of the Teutonic dialects
on the continent, were called <i>barons</i>, az they were called
<i>thanes</i> by the Saxons in England: That after the irruption
of the northern nations into the south of
Europe, the conquered lands were divided among the
great officers and their retainers, az fees or stipendiary
feuds, on the honorable tenure of military service:
That the princes, erls and barons, hav been, from time
immemorial, the assistant judges in the kings courts, and
eech of them, a cheef judge, with power of holding courts,
on hiz own demesnes: That parliaments on the continent
were <i>assemblies of barons</i>, and originally <i>courts of justice</i>,
az they are still in France: That the word <i>peers</i> waz
first used on the continent, to denote the members of
this supreme judicial court, and in its primitiv sense,
az derived from <i>bar</i> or <i>par</i>, it signified freemen or landholders;
and thence came to denote <i>judges</i>, who were
originally the proprietors of lands or manors: That
this latter sense iz its tru meening, whether applied to
the house of lords or to a common jury, who were anciently
the <i>judges</i> of the inferior courts, and are still, in
many cases, judges of law az well az fact, notwithstanding
the modern distinction, which haz taken place
in consequence of an extensiv and vastly complicated
system of jurisprudence: That the house of lords in
England retains the primitiv sense of the word <i>peers</i>, az
well az the original right of <i>judging</i> in the last resort,
and this house alone iz a <i>parliament</i>, according to the
ancient meening of the word on the continent: That
the <i>freemen</i> mentioned in Magna Charta and all the old
law writers, were thoze who held their lands by honorable
service, for term of life, or had estates of inheritance;
and that the lazzi, villiens or bondmen, who
constituted the major part of the nation, were not comprehended
under the words <i>liberi homines</i>, were not entitled
to be jurors themselves, and consequently could
not be tried by their <i>equals</i>: That the twelv jurors
<span class="pb" id="Pg289">[pg 289]</span>
among the Saxons were the <i>cheef men</i> of the county and
judges: That the idea of <i>equality</i> in the jurors or
judges waz introduced by the pride of the nobility,
and the humble condition of their tenants, under the
invidious distinctions of ranks created by the feudal
system: That this idea however haz been the meens
of preserving the rights of both in England; while the
nations on the continent, having been less successful in
their struggles, and not having wrested the <i>right of
judging</i> from the barons, the original <i>peers</i> or proprietors
of that right, hav not acquired a privilege, inestimable
in a country where distinctions of rank prevail,
and do not enjoy the blessings of equal liberty: That
this privilege haz been considerably extended in England,
by the abolition of military tenures, and the diffusion
of property among the commons: But that
America haz given the privilege its utmost extension,
by making laws of inheritance that enable <i>every man</i> to
be a freeholder; thus reducing the English theory to
practice, and entitling every man literally to the right
of <i>trial by hiz equals</i>.</p>

<p>How far theze conclusions are supported by the foregoing
authorities and arguments, every reeder will
judge for himself. I hav ventured my opinions with
my usual frankness, in opposition to thoze of the sages
of the law, which hav been receeved for centuries.
The vast weight of authority, and long established prepossessions
of men in favor of a different theory, make
me diffident of my own opinions on this subject; but
there are many passages in ancient law writings, and
many customs and laws still existing in the English
constitution and government, which I cannot explain
and reconcile on any other hypothesis.</p>

<p>The excellence of trial by peers, in ancient times,
appeers to me to hav consisted in this; that twelv indifferent
men of the naborhood, with the power of judges,
were the guardians of life and property against the
rapacity of the lord of the manor or hiz deputy. It iz
a fact well known that <i>sheriffs</i>, the deputies of the erls,
were in several counties hereditary officers; but when
<span class="pb" id="Pg290">[pg 290]</span>
they were not, they had almost-unlimitted powers in
the shire, which they often abused to oppress the peeple.
Under the feudal system they appeer to hav been
almost absolute tyrants; and the undue exercise of
their powers, probably gave rise to thoze articles of
Magna Charta, which declare, that "no freeman shall
be taken, imprisoned, or diseized of hiz freehold, liberties,
or free customs, but by the lawful judgement of
hiz peers, or by legal process; that sheriffs should not
hold county courts above once a month; that sheriffs,
castellans, coroners, and kings bailiffs, should be restrained
from holding pleas of the crown; that sheriffs, who
had the management of the crown revenues, within
their several districts, should not raize the farms of
counties, hundreds and tythes, according to their plezure."
Theze provisions were evidently designed to
remedy actual evils; the violence and usurpations of
the executiv officers, who acted under the king, or the
great lords, with powers almost uncontrolled.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" title="In the time of Henry II, there were in England eleven hundred and fifteen castles, and az many tyrants az lords of castles. William of Newbury says, in the reign of Stephen, 'Erant in Anglia quodammodo tot reges, vel potius tyranni, quot domini castellorum.' It waz the tyranny of theze lords or their deputies, which rendered the intervention of twelv judges of the naborhood, highly necessary to preserve the peeple from the impositions of their rapacious masters...." class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Against
such petty tyrants, the revival or confirmation of the
right of trial by twelv freeholders of the vicinage, must
hav been a capital security: But freeholders alone
could be impannelled on a jury; <i>freeholders</i> alone could
be diseized of <i>freeholds</i>; consequently the privilege of
being tried by <i>equals</i>, could extend to freeholders only.
With respect to all others, the excellence of the institution
could not consist in the <i>equality of condition</i> in the
jurors; but in having twelv substantial freemen, impartial,
independent men, unaccustomed to oppression,
to check and control the ministers of justice.</p>

<p>Since the separation of court and jury, law and fact,
juries, in civil cases, hav become of less consequence.
<span class="pb" id="Pg291">[pg 291]</span>
Judges are appointed by the representativs of the peeple,
ether in legislature or some other form, and are removeable
for misbehavior. They are usually az good
judges of fact as a jury, and better judges of law. One
state<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" title="Connecticut." class="fnanchor">[127]</a> haz a statute empowering the parties to submit
fact az well az law to the court. This places the
court on its Saxon institution, except az to the number
of judges. It iz also a common practice for the
parties to agree on the facts, and submit the law to the
court. The practice supersedes a jury. On commercial
questions an ordinary jury are altogether unfit to
decide; they are incompetent judges, because commerce
iz regulated by peculiar laws, best known by
merchants. Hence the institution of chambers of
commerce, and the practice of referring causes to arbitrators
of the mercantile profession.</p>

<p>But the principal valu and excellence of juries are
preserved in criminal causes. Judges, by long custom,
become hardened in the business of condemning, and
may sometimes pronounce sentence, which, even when
legal, may be unnecessary. Jurors, less accustomed to
the cruel task, retain thoze feelings which sometimes
pleed against evidence, in favor of humanity, and
soften the rigor of penal laws.</p>

<p>I shall cloze theze remarks with two quotations from
very respectable authors.</p>

<p>What Camden haz collected concerning the word
<i>baron</i>, serves to illustrate and confirm my opinions on
this subject; and the reeder will be pleezed with the
following passage from his Britannia, Vol. I, page 238.</p>

<p>"Among the greater nobility, the barons hav next
place. And here, tho I am not ignorant what the
lerned write concerning the signification of this word
in Cicero; yet I am willing to cloze with the opinion
of Isidore, and of an ancient grammarian, who will hav
<i>barons</i> to be mercenary soldiers. This seems to be
pretty plain from that known place of Hirtius in the
Alexandrian war; "they run to the assistance of Cassius;
for he always used to hav <i>barons</i>, and a good
<span class="pb" id="Pg292">[pg 292]</span>
number of soldiers for sudden occasions, with their
weapons reddy, about him, and separate from the rest."
Nor iz the old Latin and Greek Glossary against us,
when it translates <i>baro</i> by Î±Î½Î·Ï a man; az always in
the laws of the Longobards, <i>baro</i> iz used for a man.</p>

<p>The etymologies of this name which some hav fancied,
do not by any meens please me. The French
heralds will hav barons to be so called from <i>par-hommes</i>
in French; that iz, of equal dignity; the English
lawyers say it iz from <i>robora belli</i>, the sinews of war;
some Germans think it a contraction of banner-heirs,
i. e. standard bearers; and Isidore derives it from bareis,
i. e. grave or weighty. Alciatus thinks the name
comes from the <i>berones</i>, an ancient peeple of Spain,
which he says were formerly stipendiaries; but that
other, from the German <i>bar</i>, i. e. <i>a free man</i>, pleezes
me better.</p>

<p>The precise time when this name came into our
island, I hav not yet discovered: The Britons disown
it; and there iz not the leest mention made of it in the
Saxon laws, nor iz it reckoned in Alfrick's Glossary
among the titles of honor; for there, <i>dominus</i> iz translated
<i>laford</i>, which we hav contracted into <i>lord</i>. And
among the Danes, the free lords, such az our barons
are at this day, were called thanes, and (and az Andreas
Velleius tells us) are termed so still. In Burgundy,
the use of this name iz very ancient;<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" title="About the year 580." class="fnanchor">[128]</a> for Gregory of
Tours says thus, "the barons of Burgundy, az well
bishops az others of the laity, &amp;c." The first mention
of a baron in England, that I hav met with, iz in a
fragment of the laws of Canutus, king of England and
Denmark, and even there, according to different copies,
it iz read vironus, baronus, and thani. But that
the barons are there ment, iz plain from the laws of
William the conqueror; in which that word in the
laws of Canutus iz translated by <i>baro</i>. Take the whole
passage. "Let the exercitals<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" title="Heriots or reliefs." class="fnanchor">[129]</a> be so moderated, az to
be tolerable. An erl shall provide such things az are
fitting, eight horses, four saddled and four unsaddled;
<span class="pb" id="Pg293">[pg 293]</span>
four steel caps, and four coats of mail; eight javelins,<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" title="LancÃ¦e." class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
and az many shields; four swords, and two hundred
mancae<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" title="Possibly for MancusÃ¦, i. e. thirty pence." class="fnanchor">[131]</a> of gold. But a kings <i>viron</i> or <i>baron</i>, who iz
next to him, shall hav four horses, two saddled and
two unsaddled; two swords, four javelins, and az many
shields, one steel cap, and fifty mancae of gold."</p>

<p>In the beginning of the Norman times, the valvasors
and thanes were reckoned in order and dignity, next
to the erls and barons, and the greater valvasors (if we
may beleev thoze who hav written concerning feudal
tenures) were the same that barons are now. So that
baro may seem to hav come from that name; which
time haz, by little and little, made somewhat smoother.
But even then it was waz not a title of any great honor;
for in thoze times there were erls who had their
barons under them: And I remember, I hav red in
the ancient constitutions of France, that there were ten
barons under one erl, and az many cheeftans<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" title="Capatanei." class="fnanchor">[132]</a> under a
baron. It iz likewise certain, that there are charters
since the Norman conquest, wherein the erls write
thus: "To all my barons, az well French az English,
greeting, &amp;c." Nay, even citizens of the better rank
were called <i>barons</i>; so in domesday book the citizens of
Warwick are stiled <i>barons</i>; and the citizens of London,
with the inhabitants of the cinque ports, had the same
title given them. But a few years after, az senators of
Rome were chosen according to their estates, so they
were accounted <i>barons</i> with us, who held their lands by
an entire barony, or thirteen knights fees, and one third
of a knights fee, every fee (az we hav had it in ancient
book) being computed at twenty pounds, which in all
make four hundred marks; for that waz the value of
one entire barony; and they who had land and revenues
to this value, were wont to be summoned to parliament.
It seems to <i>hav been a dignity, with jurisdiction, which our
court-barons in some mezure show.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" title="This opinion of the lerned Camden, adds no small weight to my conjectures reflecting the origin of trial per pares." class="fnanchor">[133]</a> And the great number
of barons iz an argument that they were such lords who could
<span class="pb" id="Pg294">[pg 294]</span>
hold pleez within their own jurisdiction</i>, (like thoze
whom the Germans call free-heirs) especially if they
had their castles; for then they answered the definition
of Baldus, the famous lawyer, who calls him a baron,
that had a mere and mixt government in some castle,
by the grant of the prince. And (az some would hav
it) all who held baronies, seem to hav claimed that
honor; so that some of our lawyers think, that baron
and barony, erl and erldom, duke and dukedom, king
and kingdom, were in the nature of conjugates. It
iz certain, that in that age, king Henry III, reckoned
one hundred and fifty baronies in England. From
hence it iz, that in the charters and histories of that
age, almost all noblemen are stiled barons; a name,
which in thoze times waz exceeding honorable; the
baronage of England including in a manner all the
prime orders of the kingdom, dukes, marquisses, erls
and barons.</p>

<p>But that name haz been much more honorable since
king Henry III, out of such a multitude, which waz
seditious and turbulent, summoned to parliament by
writ, some of the best<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" title="Optimos." class="fnanchor">[134]</a> only; "for he," (the words
are taken out of an author of considerable antiquity)
"after thoze great disturbances and heart-burnings between
himself, Simon de Montefort, and other barons,
were laid; appointed and ordained, that all such erls
and barons of the kingdom of England, to whom the
king should vouchsafe to direct hiz writs of summons,
should come to hiz parliament, and no others, unless
their lord the king should pleeze to direct other writs to
them also." And what he began a little before hiz
deth, waz strictly observed by Edward the I, and hiz
successors. From that time they were only looked on
as barons of the kingdom, whom the king by such writs
of summons had called to parliament; until Richard
the II, in the eleventh year of hiz reign, created John
de Beauchamp of Holt, baron of Herderminster, by the
delivery of a diploma, bearing date the tenth of October.
From which time, the kings hav often conferred
<span class="pb" id="Pg295">[pg 295]</span>
that honor by diploma, (or rather honorary letters)
and the putting on of an honorary long robe. And
that way of creating barons by diploma, and the other
of writs of summons, are in use at this day; tho they
are mentioned therein not by the name of <i>baron</i>, but of
<i>chevalier</i>. They who are thus created, are called barons
of parliament, barons of the kingdom, and barons
honorary, to distinguish them from thoze who are commonly
called barons according to the ancient constitution;
az thoze of Burford and Walton, and such az
were barons to the counts Palatine of Chester, and of
Penbroch, who were feudal, and barons by tenure
only."</p>

<p>This account of Camden's, iz alone sufficient to
convince me, that my opinions are right respecting
the origin and signification of the word <i>baron</i>. But
this author cleerly mistakes the meening in the passage
quoted from Hirtius. "Cassius used to hav <i>barons</i>,
and a good number of <i>soldiers</i>, for sudden occasions."
Insted of mercenary soldiers, <i>barons</i> here meens the
<i>comites</i>, retainers, who were chosen men, and who served
their cheef voluntarily. Theze attached themselves
to the person of the cheef, az a military guard; at the
same time, they served to gratify the pride of the hero:
HÃ¦c dignitas, hÃ¦ vires, says Tacitus.</p>

<p>I hav before remarked that it iz probable <i>bar</i> and
<i>vir</i> are the same word. Camden tells us, the Greek
Glossary translates <i>baro</i> by Î±Î½Î·Ï, and in the laws of
William, the Norman, the <i>vironus</i>, <i>baronus</i> and <i>thanus</i>,
found in the laws of Canute, are translated by <i>baron</i> or
<i>viron</i>. <i>B</i> and <i>v</i> are convertible letters, and theze facts
amount to a convincing proof that <i>bar</i> and <i>vir</i> are the
same word, or from the same root. The progress of
the word iz this. First it denoted a man or husband,
<i>vir</i>; afterwards a freeman or proprietor of land, <i>bar</i>,
<i>baron</i>, <i>viron</i>; in proportion az the valu of lands encreesed
in Europe, the proprietors acquired welth and
influence; they claimed exclusiv judicial powers on
their manors, and thus the words <i>baron</i> and <i>peer</i> came
to signify <i>judge</i>. Under the feudal system, theze barons
<span class="pb" id="Pg296">[pg 296]</span>
became princes on their territories, subordinate only
to the king or lord paramount. Power attends property,
and theze barons finally assumed the right of controlling
kings, and trampling on their tenants. Where
the barons and princes combined, they established despotic
authority over the peeple; when they quarrelled,
one party or the other had recourse to the commons
for assistance, and waz compelled to grant them considerable
privileges.</p>

<p>The foregoing explanation of <i>baron</i> iz confirmed by
another fact now existing. In law, a <i>husband</i> iz called
<i>baron</i> to this day, <i>baron</i> and <i>femme</i>, husband and wife.
Agreeable to this idea, the terms used in ancient infeudations
by the tenant or vassal, were, <i>devenio vester
homo</i>; I become your <i>man</i>; that iz, your <i>baron</i>, in the
feudal sense of the word. And a jury, in conformity
with the same idea, were anciently called <i>homagium</i>, the
<i>homage</i>, or manhood; that iz, a court of <i>barons</i>, landholders
or free tenants.</p>

<p>I would only remark further, that Camden iz probably
mistaken in saying the Britons disown the word
<i>baron</i>. In Welsh, <i>barn</i> signifies a judge, and there can
be little dout that the word iz from the same original;
being written without the vowel <i>o</i>, agreeable to the
Hebrew manner.</p>

<p>Different nations are more or less inclined to uze
the vocal sounds and aspirates, according to the different
genius of their languages. So in Irish the word
waz pronounced with an aspirate, <i>barhon</i>, or <i>brehon</i>;
for there iz little room to dout this old Irish word iz
from the same root. At the time of the conquest of
Ireland by Henry II, the Irish were governed by the
<i>brehon law</i>, so stiled from <i>brehon</i>, the Irish name of
judges.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" title="Blackstone Com. Vol. I. 100." class="fnanchor">[135]</a> We are also told that the ancient Irish had
a custom of deciding causes by <i>twelv</i> men<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" title="Lelands Introd. to Hist. of Ireland." class="fnanchor">[136]</a> ; and authors
testify that the same practice existed in ancient
Britain.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" title="L. L. Hoeli." class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Their decision iz called by the erly writers,
<i>duodecem virale judicium</i>. In short the universality of
<span class="pb" id="Pg297">[pg 297]</span>
this word and the trial by twelv, iz a strong proof, that
all the nations of Europe sprang from a common
stock.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" title="See my Dissertations on the English language, 313." class="fnanchor">[138]</a> </p>

<p>Sir William Temple derives <i>barons</i> from the Russian
<i>boiarons</i>, and supposes the word to be of Gothic original.
Hiz only inaccuracy iz, that he takes a modern
derivativ for the primitiv root; whereas the Russian
<i>boiarons</i> itself iz derived from <i>bar</i>, az wel az <i>baron</i>.
The authority of this judicious and lerned writer wil
however confirm what I hav advanced in the foregoing
pages; I shal therefore cloze my remarks with a
passage from hiz works, vol. III. 363.</p>

<p>"I know very well how much critic haz been employed
by the most lerned, az Erasmus, Selden, Spelman,
az well az many others, about the two words
<i>baro</i> and <i>feudum</i>; and how much pains hav been taken
to deduce them from the Latin and Greek, and even
the Hebrew and Egyptian tungs; but I find no reezon,
after all they hav said, to make any doubt of their having
been both the original of the Gothic or northern
language; or of barons having been a term of dignity,
of command, or of honor, among them, and feudum of
a soldier's share of land. I find the first used abuv
eight hundred years ago, in the verses mentioned of
king Lodbrog, when one of hiz exploits waz to hav
conquered eight <i>barons</i>. And tho fees or feuda were
in use under later Roman emperors, yet they were derived
from the Gothic customs, after so great numbers
of thoze nations were introduced into the Roman armies.
Az to the word <i>baro</i>, it iz not, that I find, at all
agreed among the lerned, from whence to derive it;
but what that term imports, it iz easy to collect from
their several accounts, and confirm by what stil remains
in all the constitutions of the Gothic government.
For tho by <i>barons</i> are now ment in England such az
are created by patent, and thereby called to the house
of lords; and <i>baron</i> in Spanish signifies only a man of
worth or note, and the quality denoted by that title be
different in the several countries of Christendom; yet
<span class="pb" id="Pg298">[pg 298]</span>
there iz no question, but they were originally such persons
az, upon the conquest of any country, were, by
the conquering prince, invested in the possession of certain
tracts or proportions of free lands, or at leest az
they held by no other tenure but that of military service,
or attendance upon their prince in war with a certain
number of armed men. Theze in Germany,
France, Scotland, seem to hav had, and some stil to retain,
a sovereign power in their territories, by the exercise
of what iz called high and low justice, or the power
of judging criminal az well az civil causes, and inflicting
capital punishments. But I hav not found
any thing of this kind recorded in England, tho the
great barons had not only great number of knights, but
even petty barons holding under them.</p>

<p>I think the whole relm of England waz, by William
the conqueror, divided into baronies,<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" title="This iz not accurate. The thaneships or lordships of the Saxons, at the conquest, took the title of baronies; but the divisions probably existed before." class="fnanchor">[139]</a> however the distinctions
may hav been long since worn out; but in
Ireland they still remain, and every county there iz divided
into so many baronies, which seem to hav been
the shares of the first barons. And such as theze
great proprietors of land, composed, in all the north
west regions (of Europe) one part of the states (estates
general) of the country or kingdom."</p>

<p>Sir William Temple proceeds then to giv hiz conjectures
respecting the origin of the word <i>baron</i>. He
remarks that Guagini, in hiz description of Sarmatia,
printed in 1581, calls all thoze persons who were cheef
possessors of lands and dignities, next to the prince,
duke or palatine, in the vast empire of Muscovy, by
the common appellation of <i>boiarons</i>, now contracted
into <i>boiars</i>. From this he supposes <i>baron</i> to be derived.
It iz however much more probable that <i>baron</i> and <i>boiaron</i>
had a common root in some period of remote antiquity;
which afterwards spread into all parts of Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg299">[pg 299]</span>
With respect to trial by jury, Sir William remarks,
Vol. III. 130, that this waz undoutedly of Saxon institution,
and continued thro all the revolutions in England.
He says there are some traces of it in the first
institutions of Odin, the first great leeder of the Asiatic
Goths or GetÃ¦ into Europe. He mentions the council
of twelv, established by Odin, and thinks it probable
theze twelv men were at first both <i>judges</i> and <i>jurors</i>;
that iz, they were a court of arbitrators or referees, az
we should now style them, empowered to decide all
causes according to equitable principles and the circumstances
of each case; and their determinations afterwards
grew into precedent for their successors. In
process of time and multiplicity of business, the matter
of fact continued to be tried by twelv men of the naborhood;
but the adjudgement of punishment and
the sentence waz committed to one or two persons of
lerning or knowlege in the ancient customs, records
and traditions. Thus, he observes, in the Saxon
reigns, causes were adjudged by the aldermen and bishop
of the several shires, with the assistance of twelv
men of the same county, who are said to hav been
judges or assistants. He allows, the terms <i>jury</i> and
<i>verdict</i> were introduced by the Normans; but asserts
very justly that trials by twelv men, with that circumstance
of their unanimous agreement, were used not
only among the Saxons and Normans, but are known
to hav been az ancient in Sweden, az any records or
traditions in the kingdom; and the practice remained
in some provinces of that country, til the late revolution.</p>

<p class="center">POSTSCRIPT.</p>

<p>On further examination of this subject, I am led to
subjoin the following remarks, which are supported by
the indisputable authority of Glanville and Bracton.</p>

<p>I hav before suggested that the Saxons, prior to the
conquest, conducted most of their important affairs in
the county or sheriffs court, where all the free tenants
<span class="pb" id="Pg300">[pg 300]</span>
were bound to attend. Theze free tenants consisted of
the lesser barons, the knights and fokemen, or foccage
tenants who had freehold estates. Theze freeholders,
were, by the nature of their estates, the <i>pares curtis</i>;
they were the proper and sole <i>judges</i> of all causes triable
at the county court, which included almost all civil actions,
and they were denominated in Saxon, <i>lahmen</i>,
lawmen. The county court, thus composed of all the
freeholders in the shire, waz a tribunal of great consequence,
and inferior only to the witena-gemote, or national
assembly. The Latin riters called theze freemen
<i>pares curtis</i> and <i>sectatores</i>, <i>peers of court</i> and <i>suitors</i>.
<i>Curtis</i> iz a Saxon word latinized,<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" title="Curtis, court and the Spanish Cortez are all the same word." class="fnanchor">[140]</a> like <i>warrantizo murdrum</i>,
and hundreds of other law terms; and there iz
little dout that <i>pares</i> iz a word of similar origin.</p>

<p>But what places the point I would establish, beyond
controversy, iz, the <i>pares curtis</i> were in fact of different
ranks. The knights or lesser barons, az well az the
common foccage tenants, were included in the term
<i>pares curtis</i>; for they were bound to do suit and service
in the court of the lord paramount. Another fact, iz
of equal weight in the argument: Theze <i>pares</i>, in the
county court, tried all real actions between the nobility.
In the cause of Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, and archbishop
Lanfranc, in the reign of William the conqueror,
the king directed <i>totum Comitatum considere</i>. Many
similar instances might be cited, were it necessary.
Theze noblemen were tried by the <i>pares curtis</i>, the
peers of the county court; but who ever said they were
tried by their <i>equals</i>?</p>

<p>The Norman princes attempted to discountenance
theze shire motes of the Saxons, and substitute the trial
of facts by twelv <i>juratores</i>, men sworn to speek the
truth. In the reign of Henry II, the trial by jurors
had become common, if not general. Questions of
<i>seisin</i> were tried by twelv common freeholders; but
questions of <i>right</i> were tried by twelv knights; the
sheriff summoning <i>four</i> knights who elected the <i>twelv</i>.</p>

<p>
<span class="pb" id="Pg301">[pg 301]</span></p>

<p>I would here remark that the principal original reezon
for summoning freeholders <i>of the vicinage</i>, waz
that of their supposed personal knowlege of the fact in
dispute. The <i>jurors</i> were properly the <i>witnesses</i>. This
iz evident from circumstances and from the positiv
testimony of the erly law-riters. The first mention of
a proper jury, in any public act, iz in the constitutions
of Clarendon, 1164, where the sheriff iz directed, <i>quÃ²d
faciat jurare duodecim legales homines de vicineto, seu de
villa, quÃ²d inde veritatem secundum conscientiam suam manifestabunt</i>.
It iz said in old writers that the jury <i>must
speek the truth, if they know it</i>. If the twelv men first
summoned knew the truth, they were compelled to declare
it, under the penalty of perjury. If some knew
the facts and others did not, the latter were dismissed
and others summoned, till twelv were found who knew
the facts, ether by what they had seen and heerd themselves,
or from such testimony of their fathers and others,
az gained full credit.</p>

<p>Without attending to juries in this light, the laws
respecting them appeer beyond measure absurd and tyrannical.
Their being <i>sworn to speek the truth</i>, would
be absurd on any other ground; for had they judged
of facts on <i>testimony</i>, they would hav been sworn to declare
<i>their opinion</i>, and not the <i>truth</i>. Their <i>verdict,
vere dictum</i>, derives its name and propriety from the
same circumstance; and the present practice of swearing
them to "a tru verdict giv," when they judge of facts
only by the perhaps contradictory testimony of several
witnesses, iz, strictly speeking, absurd.</p>

<p>The keeping juries, without meet, drink or fire, can
be accounted for only on the same idea; it waz a method
to compel an agreement among men, who were <i>acquainted
with facts</i>, some of whom might at times be
obstinate, and not willing to disclose them. But how
ridiculous would it be to punish men for not agreeing
<i>in opinion</i>, about what others testified!</p>

<p>All this iz still more evident from the manner in
which many questions respecting real estates were ascertained
and determined. It waz customary for the
<span class="pb" id="Pg302">[pg 302]</span>
jurors, after they were chosen, to go upon the land to
find the tru state of the fact in question, and then deliver
their verdict. Hence the propriety of the expression
in <ins class="corr" title="clossing" id="C302">closing</ins> issues; <i>and this he prays may be enquired
of by the country</i>.</p>

<p>I would observe further, that the reezon, why appeels
from the verdict of a jury were not allowed, iz simply
this, that the jurors were supposed to hav decided
from their <i>own knowlege</i>. It waz certainly a wise provision
that the solemn declaration of men under oath,
living in the naborhood, and eye or eer witnesses of the
recent transactions between the parties, should not be
overthrown by other testimony; for all other evidence
must hav necessarily been of an inferior nature. But
the reezon haz ceesed, and there iz now nothing more
sacred in the verdict of a jury, given on the testimony
of others, than there iz in the opinions of arbitrators,
referees or auditors under oath. The laws respecting
juries are all founded on the idea that the men were
acquainted with the facts in dispute. Their verdict
waz formerly a <i>declaration of facts</i>; it iz now a mere
<i>matter of opinion</i>. In short, the original design of the
institution iz totally changed, and mostly superseded.
Since juries rely on testimony, they need not be collected
from the <i>vicinage</i>; it iz even safer to hav men who
are strangers to both plaintiff and defendant. Jurors
cannot be punished for <i>perjury</i>, for how can a man <i>perjure</i>
himself in giving hiz <i>opinion</i>? They cannot be
starved to deth, nor carted about town for disagreement;
for how iz it possible for twelv men always to
<i>think alike</i>, when they hav to form their opinions on
clashing testimonies? In short, juries do not now answer
one of the purposes for which they were at first instituted;
and however necessary they may be deemed to the
preservation of civil liberty, it appeers to me they are,
in a great measure, useless.</p>

<p>I cannot leev this subject without remarking the influence
of habit, in maintaining <i>forms</i>, when the <i>substance</i>
no longer exists. This iz neerly the case with the
whole institution of juries; but particularly in the
<span class="pb" id="Pg303">[pg 303]</span>
manner of administering the oath to them. The practice
of swearing the foreman and the other jurors separately,
still exists in some of theze states, altho the reezon
no longer remains. It originated in the manner
of delivering the verdict, which waz, for every juror
separately to answer the interrogatories of the judge.
While this practice remained, it waz very proper that
eech juror should take a separate oath; altho this formality
iz dispensed with, in administering the oath to
witnesses, in modern courts; the words, "<i>you</i> and
<i>eech of you</i> swear," being substituted for a separate administration
of the oath.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="ralign"><small>HARTFORD, SEPTEMBER, 1789.</small></span></p>
<p class="center"><big><i>The</i> INJUSTICE, ABSURDITY, <i>and</i> BAD
POLICY <i>of</i> LAWS <i>against</i> USURY.</big></p>

<p>Usury, in the primitiv sense of the word, signifies
any compensation given for the use of money;
but in modern legal acceptation, it iz the taking an exorbitant
sum for the use of money; or a sum beyond
what iz permitted by law. The municipal laws of
different states and kingdoms hav fixed different rates
of interest; so that what iz usury in one country or
state, iz legal interest in another. The propriety of
such laws iz here called in question.</p>

<p>1. It iz presumed that such laws are <i>unjust</i>. Money
iz a species of commercial property, in which a man
haz az complete ownership, az in any other chattel interest.
He haz therefore the same <i>natural</i> right to exercise
every act of ownership upon money, az upon any
other personal estate; and it iz contended, he ought to
hav the same <i>civil</i> and <i>political</i> right. He ought to hav
the same right to trade with money az with goods;
to sell, to loan and exchange it to any advantage whatever,
provided there iz no fraud in the business, and
the minds of the parties meet in the contracts. The
legislature haz no right to interfere with private contracts,
and say that a man shall make no more than a
certain profit per cent. on the sale of hiz goods, or limit
the rent of hiz house to the annual sum of forty
pounds. This position iz admitted for self evident, az
it respects every thing but money; and it must extend
to money also, unless it can be proved that the privilege
of using money in trade or otherwise without restraint,
and making what profit a man iz able by fair
contract, with gold and silver, az well az with houses
and lands, will produce some great public inconvenience,
<span class="pb" id="Pg305">[pg 305]</span>
which will warrant the state in laying the use of
such gold and silver under certain restrictions.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" title="In a conversation I had at Dr. Franklin's on this subject, the doctor admitted the principle, and remarked, that a man who haz 1000l. in cash, can loan it for six per cent. profit only; but he may bild a house with it, and if the demand for houses iz sufficient, he may rent hiz house for fifteen per cent. on the value. This iz a fair state of the argument, and I challenge my antagonists to giv a good reezon for the distinction which the laws make in the two cases;..." class="fnanchor">[141]</a> </p>

<p>The only reezon commonly given for limiting the
interest of money by law, iz, that monied men will otherwise
take advantage of the distresses of the poor and
needy, to extort from them exorbitant interest. Admit
the proposition in its utmost latitude, and it furnishes
no argument in favor of the restraint, <i>because the
restraint iz no remedy for the evil</i>. On the other hand,
it generally increases the evil; for when the law forbids
a man to take more than six per cent. for the use of hiz
money, it, at the same time, leevs him the right of
withholding hiz money from hiz distressed nabor, and
actually lays before him the strongest motivs for withholding
it. The law tuches the pride of a man, by
restraining what he deems an unalienable right, and
this consideration, added to a certainty of employing
hiz money to greater advantage, impels the man to
turn a deef eer to hiz nabors calamities, when he would
be otherwise disposed to afford relief. The law therefore,
so far from furnishing a remedy, actually doubles
the evil.</p>

<p>To proov this assertion more cleerly, let me call the
attention of my reeders to facts within their knowlege.
Every man knows that there are persons in every state,
who, thro imprudence, idleness or misfortune, become
involved, and unable to pay their dets when du.
Theze persons seldom make provision for discharging
their dets, till they are pressed by their creditors.
When they are urged by just demands or legal process,
<span class="pb" id="Pg306">[pg 306]</span>
they are under a necessity of raising money immediately:
But money iz scarce; it iz in a few men's hands,
who will not pay the full valu of lands or personal estate.
The poor detor iz then obliged to sell hiz farm
or hiz cattle, or both, at private sale or at auction, for
any price they will fetch, which iz commonly but a
small part of the valu. Now, if the detor could hav
borrowed a sum of money, at ten, fifteen, or even twenty
per cent. he might hav been a gainer by the loan;
for by being prohibited by law from borrowing money,
at a high interest, he haz been obliged to sacrifice twenty,
perhaps fifty or a hundred per cent. Laws against
usury do not help such men; on the contrary they oppress
them. Could such men get money even at
twenty per cent. they would often be benefited by the
loan; they might save their estates and avoid misery
and ruin. A prohibition of high interest only compels
the distressed to seek releef by sacrificing property in a
way not guarded against by law. Nay, I beg leev to
assert that such laws are the very meens of producing,
supporting and enriching a host of oppressors in every
state in America. There are a few men, in every
state, who are what iz called <i>beforehand</i>; theze men will
not loan money at legal interest, for this very good reezon,
they <i>can do better with it</i>, az they say; and no man
can blame another for making the most profitable use
of hiz money. Theze men therefore keep their money,
till their distressed nabor iz forced by det to sell hiz
farm; then iz the time to lay out their money; they
get the farm at their own price, which iz generally less
than half its valu. In most states, lands are sold at
auction, where they are sacrificed; and the poor owner
haz all the charges of a legal suit to pay, az wel az the
det; and the land sold for a small part of its valu.
This iz the common practice, authorized by law; so
that laws against usury only <i>create</i> an evil in one way,
by endevoring to <i>prevent it</i> in another.</p>

<p>The evil and hardships of this law, of selling real
estate on execution, hav been so great, az to giv rise to
a different mode of satisfying executions in Connecticut.
<span class="pb" id="Pg307">[pg 307]</span>
In this state, a man's person and estate are both
liable for det; but if the personal estate iz insufficient,
the creditor haz hiz election, ether to confine the dettor
in prison, or take hiz lands. But the law, which
iz so far in favor of the creditor, here steps in to prevent
a sacrifice of the real property at public sale; and ordains
that the creditor shall take it at a value, which
shall be apprized by three indifferent freeholders.
This law does injustice to the creditor; for it interferes
with the contract, and obliges him to take that for pay
which he did not engage to receev. But it favors the
dettor, in a state where money iz scarce and cannot be
eezily raized on an emergency. So far one law, by
doing injustice to creditors, corrects some of the ill effects
of the law against high interest in Connecticut;
but the remedy iz partial, for men in distress for money,
generally sell their estates at private sale, for one half
their valu; and a few monied men and rich farmers
are constantly taking advantage of their nabors calamities,
to enrich themselves. Such men make more
than fifty per cent. per ann. on their money by theze
speculations, and no law can wholly prevent them. Now
laws against usury create this very evil: They drive
money from a country; they create a necessity for it;
and then a few welthy men enrich themselves, not by
loaning at fifteen or twenty per cent. but by purchasing
lands at half price, which are sold to keep men from
jail, who, if they could hav got money for a few
months, at twenty per cent. might hav sold their estates
to advantage, or otherwise paid their dets. In
general then we may obzerv, when a man iz reduced
to the necessity of asking money at twenty per cent., hiz
situation iz such that it iz better to giv that interest,
than to risk a sale of property on a sudden to raize the
money. Laws against usury do not save such men;
it iz idle to suppose it; on the contrary, they multiply
instances of oppression, az all America can witness.</p>

<p>But the argument, if good, proovs too much. If
legislators hav a right to fix the profit on money at interest,
to prevent exorbitant demands from injuring the
<span class="pb" id="Pg308">[pg 308]</span>
necessitous, wil not the same reezon warrant a restriction
on the profits of every commodity in market? If
my rulers hav a right to say, my annual profit on
money loaned, shal be but six per cent. hav they not a
right to say the advance on my wheet shal be but six
per cent.? Where iz the difference? A poor man may
indeed be distressed by a demand of high interest, and
so he may by the high price of flour; and I beg leev
to say, that distresses from the last cause are infinitely
the most numerous, and the most deserving of legislativ
remedies. It wil perhaps be said that the price of bred,
in all cities, iz fixed by law&mdash;tru; but if the price of
wheet iz not likewise fixed, there are times of scarcity
when the law must vary the price, or the baker must
be ruined, and the poor be destitute of bred. In an
extensiv fertile country, like America, such cases may
not happen frequently; but the actual existence of the
fact proovs that such laws rather <i>follow</i> the state of the
market, than <i>regulate</i> it. And indeed it iz a question,
whether in this country, the citizens of our large towns
would not be supplied with bred at a cheeper rate, without
any regulations at all.</p>

<p>2. But the <i>absurdity</i> and <i>bad policy</i> of laws against usury,
are so obvious, that it iz surprizing scarcely an attempt
haz been made to abolish them in any country. Such
laws are absurd and impolitic, because they actually
and always produce and multiply the distresses they
are designed to remedy. It iz impossible it should be
otherwise: The very laws of nature and commerce
require that such restraints should necessarily counteract
their own design. It iz necessary that commodities
should be sometimes plenty and sometimes scarce; and
it iz equally necessary that money, the representativ of
all commodities, should be liable to the same fluctuations.
In the commercial world, money and commodities
wil always flow to that country, where they
are most wanted and wil command the most profit.
The consequence iz that a high price soon produces a
low price, and vice versa.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg309">[pg 309]</span>
Let us apply the principle to the present question.
When money can bear its own profit, its profit or the
interest arising on loans, wil be in proportion to the
profit made in commercial transactions. If a man can
make <i>twelv per cent.</i> on hiz stock, in any kind of trade
or speculation, he wil not convert that stock into cash,
and loan it at <i>six per cent.</i> While therefore commerce
or speculation wil afford a man greater profits, than the
law affords him on hiz loans of cash, he wil hav no
money to lend. The consequence iz, while the law
fixes the rate of interest lower than the annual profits of
other business, a country wil be destitute of money.</p>

<p>This iz precisely the case in America. Our remittances
to Europe and the East Indies require considerable
sums in specie to be exported; and the merchant
wil not import specie, except to facilitate the purchase
of hiz cargoes in America. He will not import it for
the purpose of loaning, because hiz stock in trade affords
a better profit. The few landholders who hav a
little cash abuv their annual expenditures, wil not loan
it; for they can make twelv, fifteen, eighteen per cent.
on their money by the purchase of certificates, and
more on the purchase of lands. There are therefore
no motivs, no inducements, for the welthy citizens to
loan money, and consequently when a man iz distressed
to make a payment, he iz compelled to sacrifice property
to perhaps five times the valu of the det; because
the law will not permit hiz nabor to take twelv or fifteen
per cent. per ann. for the loan of money, a few
months; when he haz the money, and would gladly
releev hiz frend, if he could receev an adequate compensation.</p>

<p>Thus laws against usury drive cash from a country.
They really and continually create a scarcity of an article,
and then restrain men from raizing the price, in
proportion to that scarcity. They create distresses of
the poor, and at the same time, create an impossibility
of releef. Were money left, like all kinds of commodities,
to command its own price in market; whenever
its price should rize abuv the usual cleer profit of other
<span class="pb" id="Pg310">[pg 310]</span>
business, men would import specie, or turn their stock
into cash, and loan it on good security; for no man
would submit to the drudgery of business, if he could
make money az fast by lying stil, with hiz money at interest.
Had money been permitted to bear its own
price according to the demand for it in America since
the war, it would hav been kept in the country, or introduced
til the rate of interest had fallen, even below
the legal standard. Limit the profit on any article of
life, and set the price so low that peeple can make more
by deeling in other articles, and the articles so fixed wil
become scarce and deer. Were the legislatures of the
several states to say that our traders should make but
one per cent. on salt, they would not bring cargoes of
it to the country. It would be az scarce az money iz
now. Let the price of wheet be fixed at half a dollar
a bushel, and in two years we should not hav a bushel
in market. It iz the same case with money. The low
profits on the use of money, expel it from the country,
and none can be obtained at the legal price. Let
the interest rize to any sum which can be obtained, and
in two years, it would be az eezy to borrow money at
a low interest, az it iz now difficult to command it at
any price. The laws of nature wil continue to opperate,
in spite of the feeble opposition of human power.</p>

<p>Another consideration demands our notice. The
laws against usury increase the distresses of the needy,
by enhancing the risk, and consequently the insurance
on loans.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" title="See Blackstone on this subject, Com. Vol. II. 455, where the author's reezoning holds good, whether against fixing the value of horse hire or money lent. All exorbitant demands are unjust in foro conscientiÃ¦; but what right haz a legislature to fix the price of money loaned, and not of house-rent?" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> It iz fruitless to attempt to prevent loans of
money. When men are pressed for money, they can
always find persons to supply them, upon <i>some</i> terms.
But az a loan of money at a higher rate of interest than
iz allowed by law, exposes the lender to a loss of the
money, and a fine or forfiture besides, hiz demand for
the use of hiz money wil rize in proportion to that risk.
<span class="pb" id="Pg311">[pg 311]</span>
This haz always been one of the most pernicious effects
of such laws. So that the law, not only creates
a scarcity in the first instance, but actually raizes the
demand of interest much abuv the natural demand required
by that scarcity. In short, insted of releeving
the detter, it multiplies hiz distresses four fold.</p>

<p>Besides, such laws, like all national restrictions on
trade, tend to make men dishonest, in particular things,
and thus weeken the powers of the moral faculty.
There are ten thousand ways of evading such laws,
and slight evasions gradually produce a habit of violating
law, and harden the mind against the feer of its penalties.
Indeed, such laws tend to undermine that confidence
which iz the basis of social intercourse. Laws
which encourage <i>informations</i>, should be enacted with
caution. Such are laws against usury. A man haz
often the strongest temptation to be a treecherous rascal,
by inducing hiz frend to loan him money, on illegal
interest, and then betraying him. This species of villany
waz lately carried so far in Massachusetts, az to
induce the legislature to repeel a clauze of their law
against usury. And a man of morality must shudder,
while he reeds the legal prosecutions and adjudications
in England upon their statutes of usury.</p>

<p>The absurdity of attempting to <i>fix the valu of money</i>
iz another objection to it of no small consequence. The
valu of it depends wholly on the quantity in circulation
and the demand. In this respect it resembles all other
articles of trade; and who ever thought of fixing the
price of goods by law?<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" title="The legislatures of several states during the late war, were rash enough to make the attempt; and the success of the scheme waz just equal to the wisdom that planned it." class="fnanchor">[143]</a> It iz almost impossible for a
legislature to ascertain exactly the valu of money at any
one time; and utterly impossible to say that the valu
when ascertained, shall continu the same for six months.
Nay, two slates adjoining eech other may estimate the
use of money very differently at the same period. In
New York the legal interest iz seven per cent. in New
England but six. A man may therefore do that legally
<span class="pb" id="Pg312">[pg 312]</span>
in one state, which in the others would expoze him
to a severe penalty.</p>

<p>In ancient Rome, the interest waz twelv per cent.
The emperor Justinian reduced it to four, but allowed
higher interest to be taken of merchants, on account of
the risk. In Holland, when Grotius wrote, the common
interest waz eight per cent.; but twelv to merchants.
In England, the statute 37th, Henry VIII, confined
interest to <i>ten</i> per cent. By the 21st James I, it
waz reduced to eight; by the 12th Charles II, to six;
and by 12th Ann, to five, the present legal interest in
that country.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" title="Blackstone Vol. II. 462." class="fnanchor">[144]</a> </p>

<p>Postlethwaite remarks very justly that theze laws hav
not ascertained the real valu or interest of money; for
when the legal interest haz been six per cent. the real
interest haz sometimes been four; and when the legal
interest haz been five, the real interest haz sometimes
been seven. Indeed the interest of money depends on
such a combination of circumstances, az the scarcity of
money, the demand in market, and the hazard, that an
attempt to find and fix a permanent rate, iz one of the
most visionary schemes that a public body can undertake.
To proov the impossibility of such a scheme, I
would only mention the continual practice of violating
laws against usury; which would not be the case, if the
real valu of money had been ascertained and fixed.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" title="What are marine insurances, bottomry, loans at respondentia and annuities for life, but exceptions to the general law against usury? The necessity of higher interest than common iz pleeded for theze exceptions. Very good; but they proov the absurdity of attempting to fix that, which the laws of nature and commerce require should be fluctuating. Such laws are partial and iniquitous." class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
If legislatures had found the tru valu of the use of
money, there would hav been fewer violations of their
laws: If they hav, in any case, fixed a rate of interest
lower than the real valu, they hav violated the rights of
their subjects. This iz a serious consideration; and
perhaps in no instance are the laws of England and
America more strongly marked with the traces of ancient
<span class="pb" id="Pg313">[pg 313]</span>
prejudice and barbarity, than in the prohibition
which prevents a man from using hiz <i>money</i> az he pleezes,
while he may demand any sum whatever for the
use of hiz other property.</p>

<p>The only power, I conceev, a legislature haz to determin
what interest shall arize on the use of money, or
property, iz where the parties hav not determined it by
agreement. Thus when a man haz taken up goods
upon credit, or where, by any other legal meens, a man
becomes possessed of anothers money or estate, without
a specific stipulation for interest, the law very properly
steps in and ascertains the sum which the detter shall
pay for the use of that money. But to make a law
that a man shall not take but six per cent. for the use
of money, when the borrower iz willing to giv more,
and the lender cannot part with hiz money at that rate
of interest, iz a daring violation of private rights, an
injury often to both parties, and productiv of innumerable
embarrassments to commerce.</p>

<p>We are told that such laws are necessary to guard
men from the oppression of the rich. What an error!
Waz a monied man ever compelled to assist a distressed
nabor, by the forfitures incurred by such laws? Iz not
hiz money hiz own? Wil he lend it all, if it should
not be for hiz benefit? Besides, cannot a man in
necessity alienate hiz property for one fourth of its
valu? Are not such bona fide contracts made every
day to raize money to answer a temporary purpose?
Nay, hav not the laws of all commercial states authorized
<i>sales by auction</i>, where any man may part with hiz
property for a fourth of its valu? Iz there any remedy
in law against such a sacrifice of a man's estate?
Wherein then consists the security of laws against usury?
In the name of common sense and common equity,
let legislators be consistent. If men are improvident,
lazy and careless, a loss of property wil be their punishment,
and no mezures of government wil prevent it.</p>

<p>To what then shall we ascribe the severe laws against
high interest, which hav been and stil are existing in
most commercial countries? I presume the cause may
<span class="pb" id="Pg314">[pg 314]</span>
be easily assigned. The Jewish prohibition, not to
take interest, except of strangers, first gave rise to douts
in the minds of our pious christian forefathers, with respect
to the legality of any interest at all. This produced,
in the dark ages, severe ecclesiastical laws against
taking any thing for the use of money; and theze laws
originated a general prejudice against it, thro the Christian
world.</p>

<p>In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, commerce
began to revive; but az there waz but little money,
and trade waz lucrativ, because in few hands, money
bore a very high interest. In some parts of Europe,
the interest waz forty per cent. Even with this interest,
certain Italian traders could make an annual profit,
and therefore it waz for their benefit to giv it. It however
rendered them very unpopular.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" title="Robertsons Charles V. Vol. I. 280." class="fnanchor">[146]</a> </p>

<p>The Jews, for their infidelity, had been considered
by the Christians az outcasts on earth. Severe laws
were enacted against them in almost every country;
depriving them of the rights of citizens, and forbidding
them to hold real estates. Proscribed and insulted, the
poor Jews were compelled to turn their <i>hand against
every man</i> in their own defence. They commenced
strolling traders and bankers, and by theze meens commanded
a large share of the money in every kingdom.</p>

<p>With this command of cash, the Jews very justly
compensated themselves for the injuries they suffered
from the tyrannical laws which existed against them.
They loaned money at the highest rate of interest they
could obtain. Hence the general karacter of the Jews,
and the prejudice against them that survives to this enlightened
period.</p>

<p>It iz very probable, that before the discovery of the
American mines, money waz so scarce in Europe, that
a few brokers in eech kingdom might engross such a
share, az to hav it in their power to oppress peeple.
This waz evidently the case in England, about the
reign of Edward I, and the parliament thought proper
to interfere and restrain the evil. Laws against usury
<span class="pb" id="Pg315">[pg 315]</span>
were doutless necessary and useful at that time. But
since the world haz been filled with gold and silver
from South America, and nations hav opened an intercourse
with eech other, there never can be a want of
specie, where a country can supply produce enough to
exchange for it. It haz become a mere fluid in the
commercial world; and in order to obtain a supply, in
a country abounding with produce and manufactures,
the legislature haz nothing to do, but let it bear its
own price; let it command its own valu, ether at interest,
or in exchange for commodities.</p>

<p>Laws against usury therefore I consider az originating
ether in the necessity of the times, which long ago
ceesed, or in a bigotted prejudice against the Jews,
which waz az barbarous formerly, az it iz now infamous.
Laws restraining the interest of money I now
consider, in the same light, az I do laws against freedom
of conscience. And were it not for the force of
habit, I should az soon expect to see a modern legislature
ordering a pious sectary to the stake for hiz principles,
az to see them gravely passing a law, to limit the
profit on the use of hiz money. And unless the legislatures
of this enlightened age should repeel such laws,
and place money on a footing with other property,
they will be considered az accessory to a direct violation
of the deerest rights of men, and will be answerable for
more frauds, perjuries, treechery and expensiv litigations,
than proceed from any other single cause in society.
I am so firmly persuaded of the truth of theze
principles, that I venture to predict, the opinions of
men will be changed in less than half a century, and
posterity will wonder that their forefathers could think
of maintaining a position so absurd and contradictory,
az that men hav no right to make more than six per
cent. on the <i>loan of money</i>, while they hav an indefeezable
right to make unlimited profit on their money in
any other manner. They will vew laws against usury
in the same light that we do the inquisition in Spain,
the execution of gypsies and witches in the last century,
<span class="pb" id="Pg316">[pg 316]</span>
or thoze laws of England which make 100l. annual
income necessary to qualify a man for killing a partridge,
while they allow <i>forty shillings</i> only to qualify
him for electing a knight of the shire.</p>

<p class="center"><big><i>On</i> ALLEGIANCE.</big></p>

<p>Writers on law divide allegiance into two
kinds, <i>natural</i> and <i>local</i>. "Natural allegiance
iz such az iz du from all men born within the kings
dominions, immediately upon their berth. For immediately
upon their berth, they are under the kings protection;
at a time too when (during their infancy)
they are incapable of protecting themselves. Natural
allegiance iz therefore a det of gratitude, which cannot
be forfeited, cancelled or altered, by any change of
time, place or circumstances; nor by any thing but
the united concurrence of the legislature. An Englishman
who remoovs to France or to China, owes the
same allegiance to the king of England there az at
home, and twenty years hence az wel az now. For it
iz a principle of universal law, that the natural born
subject of one prince cannot by any act of hiz own,
no, not by swearing allegiance to another, put off or
discharge hiz natural allegiance to the former; for hiz
natural allegiance waz intrinsic and primitiv and antecedent
to the other, and cannot be devested, without the
concurrent act of that prince to whom it waz first du.
Indeed the natural born subject of one prince, to whom
he owes allegiance, may be entangled by subjecting himself
absolutely to another; but it iz hiz own act that
brings him into theze straits and difficulties, of owing
service to two masters; and it iz unreezonable that, by
such voluntary act of hiz own, he should be able at
plezure to unloose thoze bands by which he iz connected
to hiz natural prince."<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" title="Blackstone Com. Vol. I. 369." class="fnanchor">[147]</a> </p>

<p>I mistake much, however, if the natural born subject
would be so much <i>entangled with hiz straits and difficulties</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Pg318">[pg 318]</span>
az lord Coke, Hale and Blackstone, would be, to
support their assertions and obviate the absurdities of
their reezoning.</p>

<p>It iz astonishing to observe how slowly men get rid
of old prejudices and opinions. The feudal ideas of
allegiance, which make <i>fidelity in the subject an obligation
or grateful return for the protection of the prince</i>, stil prevail,
and are made the basis of all modern reezoning
on the subject. Such ideas in the dark ages, and in
the days of feudal despotism, are not to be wondered at.
Every baron waz a tyrant on hiz manor, and az hiz
only safety consisted in hiz castle and hiz vassals, it waz
necessary to bind hiz subjects to him by oaths and superstition,
az wel az by a demand upon their gratitude.
But wil our sage writers on government and law, forever
think by tradition? Wil they never examin the
grounds of receeved opinions? Let me enquire.</p>

<p>What iz the real ground of <i>allegiance</i>? Iz it not
<i>protection</i>? Not at all. We may just az wel invert
the proposition, and say, that <i>allegiance</i> iz the ground
of <i>protection</i>. A prince iz the representativ of a nation
or state, so that allegiance to him, iz merely allegiance
to a state or body politic.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" title="Blackstone remarks that allegiance iz applicable, not only to the political capacity of the king, or regal office, but to hiz natural person and blood royal. I would ask then what blood royal there can be in a man, except in hiz kingly capacity?" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> According to our ideas, allegiance
to a king, and fidelity to a state, are the same
thing; for detach a king from all connection with a
nation or state, and he becumes a private man, and entitled
only to the rights of such. This at leest iz the
opinion of an <i>American</i>, whose mind iz not biassed by
personal attachments to a sovereign.</p>

<p>What then iz the ground of fidelity to a state? The
answer iz eezy; the <i>moral law</i>, which haz for its object
the <i>good of society</i>. This iz the basis of all obligations
in a state, whether express or implied; yet writers on
this subject hav hardly mentioned it. Blackstone indeed
takes notice of an implied, original allegiance, antecedent
to any express promis; but seems rather to
<span class="pb" id="Pg319">[pg 319]</span>
consider it az a return for the duties of the sovereign,
which he owes before coronation, than az an obligation
arising from the very constitution of society.</p>

<p>Taking the moral law or the good of society for the
ground of all allegiance, we discuver two species of duties
to be performed by every man; the <i>moral duties</i>,
which exist at all times and in all places; and certain
<i>political duties</i>, required by the municipal laws of eech
state. The first are the basis of natural or perpetual
allegiance; the last, of local allegiance. The first or
moral duties create an obligation upon every man, the
moment he iz born, which cannot be cancelled or discharged
by any act of an individual, or by any agreement
between prince and subject; the last, or political
duties, impoze an obligation upon every member of a
state or body politic, the moment he steps within its
jurisdiction, to submit peaceably to such positiv injunctions
of that state, az hav been judged necessary for its
welfare.</p>

<p>Now to maintain that an oath of allegiance wil bind
a man to perform all the last class of duties, or the positiv
duties enjoined by a particular state, and not required
by the general laws of society, when the man haz
perhaps become a member of another state, three thousand
miles distant, iz to defend the wildest notions that
can possess any man's brain. Every man iz bound always
and in all places to <i>do right, and avoid doing rong</i>;
and this with, or without taking an oath of fidelity to
any state. This iz implied allegiance, universal and
perpetual; and I deny that there iz any other ground
of this allegiance, except the universal principles of
right and rong.</p>

<p>Should it be said, that a man may bind himself <i>by
oath</i> to perform the positiv or political duties required by
a state, altho he may remoov and become a citizen of
another state; I answer, this wil involv him in the
<i>straits</i> and <i>difficulties</i> mentioned by Blackstone; for the
political duties of the two states may interfere with
eech other. The truth iz, a man haz no right to take
such an oath, nor haz a state any right to require it.
<span class="pb" id="Pg320">[pg 320]</span>
He may swear, when he enters into any kingdom or
state, that he wil be a good citizen, and submit to all
the laws of the state, <i>while he iz a member of it</i>; and
further, that he wil observe the moral law in hiz conduct
towards that society, after <i>he haz ceesed to be a member
of it</i>. Further than this, he haz no right to swear.
Az to every duty, not required by the laws of society in
general, but only by the municipal laws of a state, a
man's allegiance commences when he enters that state;
and ceeses the moment he leeves it.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" title="Except the case of Ambassadors or other agents." class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The doctrin of
a perpetual allegiance iz wholly a feudal idea; inculcated,
when every lord waz at war with hiz nabor; and
waz compelled by self preservation to attach hiz vassals
to himself by oaths, the penalties of perjury and the
forfeitures of treezon.</p>

<p>Blackstone says, in the passage already quoted, "that
natural allegiance iz a det of gratitude," because the
subject iz under the kings protection while an infant.
He might just az wel say, <i>protection iz a det of gratitude</i>
du from the prince, because the subject iz born in hiz
dominions. On this principle of gratitude, a child iz
obliged to obey and serve hiz parent, after he haz left
hiz family, and while he livs. This det, according to
the same author, cannot be cancelled, but <i>by "concurrence
of the legislature."</i> How in the name of reezon,
can an act of the legislature dissolv a <i>natural tie</i>? How
can it <i>cancel a det of gratitude</i>? Common sense looks
with disdain on such week and futile reezoning. But
if there iz such a thing az natural and perpetual allegiance,
an Englishman, who remoovs to France, cannot
take arms to defend France against an invasion from
England. Is this agreeable to the laws of nature and
society, that a man should not protect himself and hiz
property? It wil be said that the man iz within the
English king's liegeance, and entitled to hiz protection.
But the king cannot protect him; it iz beyond hiz
power, and the Englishman iz not obliged to leev
France and seek protection in England. Hiz estate and
hiz family may be in France, and if he chooses to reside
there, it iz hiz unalienable right and duty to defend
<span class="pb" id="Pg321">[pg 321]</span>
both against any invasion whatever. Every war,
except a defensiv one, iz a breech of the moral law;
but when a natural born subject of England, haz become
a citizen of France, he iz subject to the laws of
France, and bound to assist, if required, in defending
the kingdom against hiz natural prince.</p>

<p class="center"><big>EXPLANATION <i>of the</i> REEZONS, <i>why</i>
MARRIAGE <i>iz</i> PROHIBITED <i>between</i>
NATURAL RELATIONS.</big></p>

<p>Much haz been said and written to ascertain between
what relations marriage ought to be permitted.
The civil, the canon, and the English laws,
differ az to the degrees of consanguinity necessary to
render this connection improper. A detail of the arguments
on this subject, and even a recapitulation of
the decrees of ecclesiastical councils, in the erly ages of
the church, would be tedious and uninteresting. I
shall only offer a few thoughts of my own on the question,
with a view to illustrate a single point, which haz
been agitated in modern times, and on which the different
American states hav passed different decisions.
The point iz, whether a man should be permitted to
marry hiz former wife's sister. In some states this iz
permitted; in others, prohibited.</p>

<p>Thoze who favor the prohibition, ground their reezon
on the Levitical law, which says a man shall not
marry hiz wife's sister, during the life of hiz wife, to
vex her. This prohibition, while it restrains a man
from having two sisters for wives at the same time,
among a peeple where poligamy waz permitted, iz a
negativ pregnant, and a strong argument that a man
waz allowed, after the deth of a wife, to marry her
sister.</p>

<p>The Jewish law, however divine, waz designed for a
particular nation, and iz no farther binding upon other
nations, than it respects the natural and social duties.
In no one particular, hav men been more mistaken,
than in explaining divine commands. It haz been
sufficient for them to reseiv a law into the wil of God,
<span class="pb" id="Pg323">[pg 323]</span>
without <ins class="corr" title="examinining" id="C323">examining</ins> into the reezons for which the
law waz revealed. They seem to hav inverted the
foundation of moral obligation, in supposing the moral
law to derive its propriety and fitness originally from the
wil of Deity, rather than from the nature of things.
They talk about the fitness and unfitness of things, independent,
not only of society, but of God himself.
Such wild notions, I presume, are not common. There
could be no fitness nor unfitness of things, before things
were made; nor could right and rong exist without
social beings. The moral duties therefore are not
right, merely because they are commanded by God;
but they are commanded by him, because they are
right. The propriety or fitness of them depends on
the very nature of society; and this fitness, which waz
coeval with creation, waz the ground of the divine
command.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" title="It may be said, that moral right and rong must ultimately be resolved into the wil of Deity, because society itself depends on hiz wil. This iz conceded; I only contend that moral fitness and unfitness result immediately from the state of created beings, with relation to eech other, and not from any arbitrary rules imposed by Deity, subsequent to creation." class="fnanchor">[150]</a> </p>

<p>The law of Moses, regulating marriages, waz founded
on this propriety or fitness of things. A divine
command givs a sanction to the law; but the propriety
of it existed prior to the command. The reezons for
prohibiting marriage between certain relations are important;
yet they seem not to be understood. It haz
been sufficient, in discussing this point, to say, <i>such iz
the law of God</i>; and few attempts hav been made to
find the reezons of it, by which alone its extent and
authority can be ascertained.</p>

<p>There are two rules, furnished by the laws of nature,
for regulating matrimonial connections. The first iz,
that marriage, which iz a social and civil connection,
should not interfere with a natural relation, so az to
defeet or destroy its duties and rights. Thus it iz
highly improper that an aunt should marry her nephew,
or a <ins class="err" title="godfather" id="E323">grandfather</ins> hiz grand daughter; because the duties
<span class="pb" id="Pg324">[pg 324]</span>
and rights of the natural relation, would be superseded
by the positiv duties and rights of the civil connection.</p>

<p>The other rule iz much more important. It iz a
law of nature that vegetables should degenerate, if
planted continually on the same soil. Hence the
change of seeds among farmers. Animals degenerate
on the same principle. The physical causes of this law
of nature, are perhaps among the arcana of creation;
but the effects are obvious; and it iz surprizing that
modern writers on law and ethics should pass over almost
the only reezons of prohibiting marriage between
blood relations. Consanguinity, and not affinity, iz
the ground of the prohibition.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" title="By the ancient laws of England, relations in the same degree, whether by consanguinity or affinity, were placed exactly on a footing. See the suttle reezoning by which the prohibitions were supported, in Reeve's History of the English Laws, Vol. IV." class="fnanchor">[151]</a> </p>

<p>It iz no crime for brothers and sisters to intermarry,
except the fatal consequences to society; for were it
generally practised, men would soon become a race of
pigmies. It iz no crime for brothers and sisters children
to intermarry, and this iz often practised; but such
near blood connections often produce imperfect children.
The common peeple hav hence drawn an argument to
proov such connections criminal; considering weakness,
sickness and deformity in the offspring az judgements
upon the parents. Superstition iz often awake,
when reezon iz asleep. It iz just az criminal for a
man to marry hiz cousin, az it iz to sow flax every
year on the same ground; but when he does this, he
must not complain, if he haz an indifferent crop.</p>

<p>Here then the question occurs, iz it proper for a man
to marry hiz wife's sister? The answer iz plain. The
practice does not interfere with any law of nature or
society; and there iz not the smallest impropriety in a
man's marrying ten sisters of hiz wife in succession.
There iz no natural relation destroyed; there iz no relation
by blood; and <i>cessante ratione, cessat et ipsa Lex</i>;
the law ceeses when the reezon of it ceeses.</p>

<p class="center"><big>MISCELLANEOUS REMARKS <i>on</i> DIVIZIONS
<i>of</i> PROPERTY, GUVERNMENT,
EDUCATION, RELIGION,
AGRICULTURE, SLAVERY, COMMERCE,
CLIMATE <i>and</i> DISEEZES <i>in
the</i> UNITED STATES.</big></p>

<p>The laws which respect property, hav, in all civilized
communities, formed the most important
branch of municipal regulations. Of theze, the laws
which direct the division and desent of lands, constitute
the first class; for on theze, in a great mezure, depend
the genius of guvernment and the complection of manners.</p>

<p>Savages hav very few regulations respecting property;
for there are but few things to which their desires
or necessities prompt them to lay claim. Some very
rude nations seem to hav no ideas of property, especially
in lands; but the American tribes, even when first
discuvered, claimed the lands on which they lived, and
the hunting grounds of eech tribe were marked from
thoze of its nabors, by rivers or other natural boundaries.
The Mexican and Peruvian Indians had indeed
advanced very far towards a state of civilization; and
land with them had acquired almost an European
valu; but the northern tribes, yet in the hunter state,
would often barter millions of akers for a handful of
trinkets and a few strings of wampum.</p>

<p>In the progress of nations, land acquires a valu, proportioned
to the degree of populousness; and other objects
grow into estimation, by their utility, convenience,
or some plezure they afford to the imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg326">[pg 326]</span>
In attending to the principles of guvernment, the
leeding idea that strikes the mind, iz, that political
power depends mostly on property; consequently guvernment
will take its complection from the divisions of
property in the state.</p>

<p>In despotic states, the subjects must not possess property
in fee; for an exclusiv possession of lands inspires
ideas of independence, fatal to despotism. To support
such guvernments, it iz necessary that the laws should
giv the prince a sovereign control over the property az
wel az the lives of hiz subjects. There are however
very few countries, where the guvernment iz so purely
arbitrary, that the peeple can be deprived of life and
estate, without some legal formalities. Even when the
first possession waz the voluntary gift of the prince,
grants or concessions, sanctioned by prescription, hav
often established rights in the subject, of which he cannot
be deprived without a judicial process.</p>

<p>In Europe the feudal system of tenures haz given
rise to a singular species of guvernment. Most of the
countries are said to be guverned by <i>monarkies</i>; but
many of the guvernments might, with propriety, be
called <i>aristocratic republics</i>. The barons, who possess,
the lands, hav most of the power in their own hands.
Formerly the kings were but lords of a superior rank,
<i>primi inter pares</i>; and they were originally electiv.
This iz stil the case in Poland, which continues to be
what other states in Europe were, an <i>aristocratic republic</i>.
But from the twelfth to the sixteenth century, the
princes, in many countries, were struggling to circumscribe
the power of the barons, and their attempts,
which often desolated their dominions, were attended
with various success. What they could not accomplish
by force, they sometimes obtained by stratagem.
In some countries the commons were called in to support
the royal prerogativs, and thus obtained a share in
legislation, which haz since been augmented by vast
accessions of power and influence, from a distribution
and encreese of welth. This haz been the case in
England. In other countries, the prince haz combined with
<span class="pb" id="Pg327">[pg 327]</span>
the barons to depress the peeple. Where the
prince holds the privilege of disposing of civil, military
and ecclesiastical offices, it haz been eezy to attach the
nobility to hiz interest, and by this coalition, peece haz
often been secured in a kingdom; but the peeple hav
been kept in vassalage. Thus by the laws of the feudal
system, most of the commons in Europe are kept in
a state of dependence on the great landholders.</p>

<p>But commerce haz been favorable to mankind. Az
the rules of succession to estates, every where established
in Europe, are calculated to aggrandize the <i>few</i> at the
expense of the <i>many</i>, commerce, by creating and accumulating
personal estate, haz introduced a new species
of power to ballance the influence of the landed property.
Commerce found its way from Italy and the
eest, to Germany and England, diffusing in its progress
freedom, knowlege and independence. Commerce iz
favorable to freedom; it flurishes most in republics;
indeed a free intercourse by trade iz almost fatal to despotism;
for which reezon, some princes lay it under
severe restrictions: In other countries it iz discuraged
by public opinion, which renders trade disreputable.
This iz more fatal to it, than the edicts of tyrants.</p>

<p>The basis of a democratic and a republican form of
government, iz, a fundamental law, favoring an equal
or rather a general distribution of property. It iz not
necessary nor possible that every citizen should hav exactly
an equal portion of land and goods, but the laws
of such a state should require an equal distribution of
intestate estates, and bar all perpetuities. Such laws
occasion constant revolutions of property, and thus hold
out to all men equal motivs to vigilance and industry.
They excite emulation, by giving every citizen an
equal <ins class="err" title="change" id="E327">chance</ins> of being rich and respectable.</p>

<p>In no one particular do the American states differ
from European nations more widely, than in the rules
which regulate the tenure and distribution of lands.
This circumstance alone wil, for ages at leest, prezerve
a government in the united states, very different from
any which now exists or can arize in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg328">[pg 328]</span>
In New England, intestate estates desend to all the
children or other heirs in equal portions, except to the
oldest son, who haz two shares. This exception in favor
of the oldest son, waz copied from the levitical
code, which waz made the basis of the first New England
institutions. The legislature of Massachusetts, at
their May session, 1789, abolished that absurd exception;
and nothing but inveterate habit keeps it alive
in the other states.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" title="Lands in Connecticut desend to the heirs in the following manner: First to children, and if none, then to brothers and sisters or their legal representativs of the whole blud; then to parents; then to brothers and sisters of the half blud; then to next of kin, the whole blud taking the preference when of equal degree with the half blud." class="fnanchor">[152]</a> </p>

<p>In consequence of theze laws, the peeple of New
England enjoy an equality of condition, unknown in any
other part of the world. To the same cause may be
ascribed the rapid population of theze states; for estates
by division are kept small, by which meens every
man iz obliged to labor, and labor iz the direct cause
of population. For the same reezon, the peeple of
theze states, feel and exert the pride of independence.
Their equality makes them mild and condesending, capable
of being convinced and guverned by persuasion;
but their independence renders them irritable and obstinate
in resisting force and oppression. A man by associating
familiarly with them, may eezily coax them
into hiz views, but if he assumes any airs of superiority,
he iz treeted with az little respect az a servant.
The principal inconvenience arizing from theze dispositions
iz, that a man who happens to be a little distinguished
for hiz property or superior education iz ever
exposed to their envy, and the tung of slander iz
bizzy in backbiting him. In this manner, they oppoze
distinctions of rank, with great success. This
however iz a private inconvenience; but there iz an
evil, arising from this jealousy, which deeply affects
their guvernment. Averse to distinctions, and reddy
to humble superiority, they become the dupes of a set
<span class="pb" id="Pg329">[pg 329]</span>
of artful men, who, with small talents for business
and no regard for the public interest, are always familiar
with every class of peeple, slyly hinting something to
the disadvantage of great and honest men, and pretending
to be frends to the public welfare. The peeple
are thus guverned at times by the most unqualified
men among them. If a man wil shake hands with every
one he meets, attend church constantly, and assume
a goodly countenance; if he wil not swear or play
cards, he may arrive to the first offices in the guvernment,
without one single talent for the proper discharge
of hiz duty; he may even defraud the public revenu
and be accused of it on the most indubitable evidence,
yet by laying hiz hand on hiz brest, casting hiz eyes to
heaven, and calling God to witness hiz innocence, he
may wipe away the popular suspicions, and be a fairer
candidate for preferment than before hiz accusation.
So far az the harts of the peeple are concerned, the disposition
here mentioned iz a high recommendation, for
it proves them mild, unsuspecting and humane: But
guvernment suffers a material injury from this turn of
mind; and were it not for a few men who are boldly
honest, and indefatigable in detecting impositions on
the public, the guvernment of theze states would always
be, az it often iz, in the hands of the weekest, or
wickedest of the citizens.</p>

<p>The same equality of condition haz produced a singular
manner of speeking among the peeple of New
England.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" title="See my Dissertations on the English Language, page 106." class="fnanchor">[153]</a> But the inhabitants of all the large towns,
wel bred citizens, are excepted from this remark.</p>

<p>Altho the principle iz tru that a general distribution
of lands iz the basis of a republican form of guvernment,
yet there iz an evil arising out of this distribution,
which the New England states now feel, and which
wil increase with the population of the country. The
tracts of land first taken up by the settlers, were not
very considerable; and theze having been repeetedly
divided among a number of heirs, hav left the present
proprietors almost without subsistence for their families.
<span class="pb" id="Pg330">[pg 330]</span>
Vast numbers of men do not possess more than thirty
or forty akers eech, and many not half the quantity.
It iz with difficulty that such men can support families
and pay taxes. Indeed most of them are unable to do
it; they involve themselves in det; the creditors take
the little land they possess, and the peeple are driven,
poor and helpless, into an uncultivated wilderness. Such
are the effects of an equal division of lands among
heirs; and such the causes of emigration to the western
territories. Emigration indeed iz a present remedy for
the evil; but when settlements hav raized the valu of
the western lands neerly to that on the Atlantic coast,
emigrations wil mostly ceese. They wil not entirely
ceese, until the continent iz peepled to the Pacific ocean;
and that period iz distant; but whenever they ceese,
our republican inhabitants, unable to subsist on the
small portions of land, assigned them by the laws of
division, must hav recourse to manufactures. The
holders of land wil be fewer in number, because monied
men wil hav the advantage of purchasing lands
very low of the necessitous inhabitants, who wil be
multiplied by the very laws of the state, respecting
landed property. Other laws however could not be
tolerated in theze states. In Europe, provision iz made
for younger sons, in the army, the church, the navy, or
in the numerous manufactures of the countries. But
in America, such provision cannot be made; and therefore
our laws eezely provide for all the children, where
they are not provided for by the parents.</p>

<p>By extending our views to futurity, we see considerable
changes in the condition of theze republican states.
The laws, by barring entailments, prevent the establishment
of families in permanent affluence; we are
therefore in little danger of a hereditary aristocracy.
But the same laws, by dividing inheritances, tho their
first effect iz to create equality, ultimately tend to impoverish
a great number of citizens, and thus giv a
few men, who commanded money, an advantage in
procuring lands at less than their real valu. The evil
iz increased in a state, where there iz a scarcity of cash,
<span class="pb" id="Pg331">[pg 331]</span>
occasioned by the course of trade, or by laws limiting
the interest on money loaned. Such iz the case in Connecticut.
A man who haz money may purchase wel
cultivated farms in that state for seventy, and sometimes
for fifty per cent. of the real valu. Such a situation iz
favorable to the accumulation of great estates, and the
creation of distinctions; but while alienations of real
estates are rendered necessary by the laws, the genius of
the guvernment wil not be materially changed.</p>

<p>The causes which destroyed the ancient republics
were numerous; but in Rome, one principal cause
waz, the vast inequality of fortunes, occasioned partly
by the stratagems of the patricians and partly by the
spoils of their enemies, or the exactions of tribute in
their conquered provinces. Rome, with the <i>name</i> of a
republic, waz several ages loozing the <i>spirit</i> and <i>principle</i>.
The Gracchi endevored to check the growing
evil by an agrarian law; but were not successful. In
Cesar's time, the Romans were ripened for a change of
guvernment; the <i>spirit</i> of a commonwelth waz lost,
and Cesar waz but an instrument of altering the <i>form</i>,
when it could no longer exist. Cesar iz execrated az
the tyrant of hiz country; and Brutus, who stabbed
him, iz applauded az a <i>Roman</i>. But such waz the
state of things in Rome, that Cesar waz a better ruler
than Brutus would hav been; for when the spirit of a
guvernment iz lost, the form must change.</p>

<p>Brutus would hav been a tyrannical demagogue, or
hiz zeel to restore the commonwelth would hav protracted
the civil war and factions which raged in Rome
and which finally must hav subsided in monarky. Cesar
waz absolute, but hiz guvernment waz moderate, and
hiz name waz sufficient to repress faction and prezerve
tranquillity. The zeel of Brutus waz intemperate and
rash; for when abuses hav acquired a certain degree of
strength; when they are interwoven with every part of
government, it iz prudence to suffer many evils, rather
than risk the application of a violent remedy.</p>

<p>How far the Roman history furnishes the data, on
which the politicians of America may calculate the future
<span class="pb" id="Pg332">[pg 332]</span>
changes in our form of guvernment, iz left to
every man's own opinion. Our citizens now hold
lands in fee; this renders them bold in independence:
They all labor, and therefore make hardy soldiers; they
all reed, and of course understand their rights; they
rove uncontrolled in the forest; therefore they know
the use of arms. But wil not poor peeple multiply, and
the possessions of real estates be diminished in number,
and increesed in size? Must not a great proportion of
our citizens becum manufacturers and thus looz the
bodies and the spirit of soldiers? While the mass of
knowlege wil be increesed by discuveries and experience,
wil it not be confined to fewer men? In short,
wil not our forests be levelled, or confined to a few
proprietors? and when our peeple ceese to hunt, will
not the body of them neglect the use of arms? Theze
are questions of magnitude; but the present generation
can answer them only in prospect and speculation.
At any rate, the genius of every guvernment must addapt
itself to the peculiar state and spirit of the peeple
who compose the state, and when the Americans looz
the <i>principles</i> of a free guvernment, it follows that they
wil speedily looz the <i>form</i>. Such a change would, az in
Rome, be ascribed to <i>bad</i> men; but it is more rational
to ascribe it to an imperceptible progress of corruption,
or thoze insensible changes which steel into the
best constitutions of government.</p>

<p>New England waz originally settled by a religious
sect, denominated <i>puritans</i>, who fled from the severe
restraints imposed upon dissenters in the reign of king
James I. Placed beyond the feer of control, they formed
sistems of civil and ecclesiastical government, exactly
suited to their rigid notions. All their institutions
wear <ins class="err" title="masks" id="E332">marks</ins> of an enthusiastic zeel for religion. Removed
from the tyranny of one church, they vibrated
to the other extreme, and with an ardor to bild up
Christ's kingdom, in what they quaintly call, <i>a howling
wilderness</i>, they established a tyranny of the severest
kind over the consciences and rights of their own society,
and by arbitrary decrees banished thoze who
<span class="pb" id="Pg333">[pg 333]</span>
dissented from them upon the most metaphisical points.
It waz a law of the first settlers at Boston, that none
could be free men and entitled to vote for civil rulers,
who were not in full communion with the church;
and none could be admitted to full communion, without
the recommendation of a clergyman. Theze laws
threw all the power of the state into the hands of the
clergy.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" title="See Winthrop's Journal, Mather's Magnalia, and Hutchisons Collection of papers." class="fnanchor">[154]</a> It iz equally astonishing and ridiculous to the
posterity of thoze godly peeple, to find the church and
state, in the infancy of the settlement in America, rent
with discord upon the simple question, whether "sanctification
preceeds justification." Yet hundreds of
councils were held upon this or similar points, and a
dissent from the common opinion on such trifling questions,
waz heresy, punishable with excommunication
and banishment.</p>

<p>But candor requires some apology to be made for
our ancestors. Bigotry waz not confined to the New
England settlers; it waz the characteristic of the age.
The first settlers in New Jersey, Virginia and Pensylvania,
and indeed in most of the colonies, prohibited
witchcraft under penalty of deth; tho the laws seem
not to have been executed any where except in Massachusetts.
But the fame gloomy superstition reigned
in England. The <ins class="corr" title="statues" id="C333">statutes</ins> of Henry VIII. and James I.
making witchcraft and sorcery felony without benefit
of clergy, upon which many persons suffered deth,
were not repeeled, till the ninth yeer of George II. or
about 1736. Just before the restoration in 1660, no
less than thirteen <i>gypsies</i> were condemned at one Suffolk
assizes, and executed.</p>

<p>But why should I go to former times and other states
for apologies? Iz it not eezy to find superstition and
prejudices among ourselves equally absurd and indefensible?
Does not a law against playing with cards proceed
from theze prejudices? What iz the difference
between playing with <i>spotted papers and spotted boards</i>?
Chequers, back-gammon and chess are not prohibited,
and the games are az enticing az thoze which are <ins class="corr" title="prohited" id="C333a">prohibited</ins>.
<span class="pb" id="Pg334">[pg 334]</span>
Are not such games az capable of conceelment
az any domestic concerns? Wil laws ever reech them?
Haz the legislature any right to control my family amuzements?
In short, do laws ever suppress or restrain
any species of game? By no meens; on the other
hand, I can testify from actual observation, that prohibited
games are practized az much az others, and
in states where penalties against them are most severe,
gaming iz the most frequent.</p>

<p>Again, are laws against witchcraft more absurd than
laws against usury? Did not both originate in ages of
monkish bigotry, and in the same religious scruples?
Iz it not az illiberal a prejudice to say, that a man shall
hav but six per cent. profit on money loaned, yet may
make fifty per cent. if he can, on the same valu in
goods, houses or lands; az it iz to say, that a man
shal not be a fanatic, or a woman hav the hysterics?
Haz not any man az good a right to be whimsical or superstitious,
az a legislature to be inconsistent? Az to
the right, I see no difference. A man who iz oppressed
to an obvious degree by a rich creditor, wil find releef
against the <ins class="err" title="oppressor. In a court of equity, a" id="E334">oppressor, in a court of equity. A</ins> fanatic,
who should keep a naborhood in an uproar by
hiz religious worship, would be punishable for a misdemeenor.
But when two men can make a voluntary
contract for eight per cent. interest, a contract which
eech deems favorable for himself, that he should be
punishable with a hevvy forfiture, iz a curosity in legislation,
which ought to be placed on the catalog of
papal bulls.</p>

<p>Superstition appeers in all ages under different aspects.
The sailor who repozes confidence in the horse-shoe
on hiz mast, the Roman who counts hiz beeds,
the judge who gravely sentences a witch to the gallows,
and the legislator who thinks it a crime to receev great
profits for the use of money, may be equally conscientious,
and to posterity in some future time, wil appeer
to be equally mistaken.</p>

<p>But while we contemplate the censurable laws of the
first New England settlers, let us not pass by many
<span class="pb" id="Pg335">[pg 335]</span>
excellent regulations which proceed from their religious
zeel, and which hav been the basis of institutions the
most favorable to morals, to freedom and happiness.</p>

<p>In the first place, our ancestors made provision for
supporting preechers of the gospel in every village.
Abating some rigid maxims, which were propagated
and maintained for the first century, with too much
zeel, the influence of the clergy, in New England,
haz been productiv of the happiest effects. The clergy,
being wel informed men, and scattered among the
peeple at large, hav been instrumental in diffusing
knowlege. Frends to order, and respected by their parishioners,
they hav at times saved the states from turbulence
and disorder. The advocates of liberty, they
espoused the American revolution with firmness, and
contributed to unite the peeple in a steddy opposition to
British mezures; and since the establishment of peece,
they hav had no small influence in oppozing mezures,
fatal to good faith and the rights of freemen.</p>

<p>The effects of their influence are the most generally
vizible in Connecticut, where every town iz well settled
and supports a clergyman. This state never experienced
an insurrection; its opposition to the British
power, during the war, waz steddy and unanimous;
and tender laws and paper currency hav been uniformly
reprobated since the revolution.</p>

<p>The old settlements in Massachusetts may fall under
the same character; but the western and northern
counties are exceptions. In a great proportion of the
townships, which hav been lately settled, there iz no
clergyman or other person of superior information, to
direct the popular councils and check a rizing opposition.
It waz obzerved, during the late insurrections
in thoze counties, that the towns which were destitute
of any wel informed men, furnished the most numerous
and most turbulent hosts of insurgents. The
wel informed counties on the see coast furnished scarcely
a man.</p>

<p>In addition to this, it may be remarked, that the
mildness of manners and the hospitality which prevail
<span class="pb" id="Pg336">[pg 336]</span>
among the yemanry of New England, are ascribeable
in a great meazure, to a general administration of religious
ordinances. The distinction in this respect, iz
so great between New England and some other parts
of America, that in travelling among the settlers on
the frontiers of Vermont, a man may ascertain where
the settlers were born and educated, merely by their
manner of receeving and treeting him. This iz asserted
from actual obzervation.</p>

<p>The State of Rhode Island furnishes full proofs of
what iz here said in favor of the clergy. That state
waz settled by refugees from Massachusetts, who were
banished or persecuted by the first settlers, for their religious
tenets. Roger Williams and hiz adherents imbibed
an inveterate hatred against the colony of Massachusetts,
and in particular against the clergy, whoze
rigid zeel occasioned their expulsion from the colony.
The prejudice continued among their desendants, and
to this day the inhabitants boast of their liberality of
sentiment and their freedom from the bigotry of clergymen,
which, they say, enslaves the peeple of Massachusetts
and Connecticut. This aversion to the clerical
order haz however had a pernicious effect in the
state. The body of the peeple, unaccustomed to the
sobriety and decent deportment necessary in religious
worship, and despizing the puritanical manners of their
nabors, are educated in licentiousness and void of principle.
To this source may be traced the most unjust
and tyrannical laws that ever disgraced a popular assembly,
and a perseverance in executing them, which can
proceed only from obstinate ignorance and dishonest
views. The large trading towns are excepted from this
description; the inhabitants of which are well informed,
polite, liberal, and firm supporters of good government;
<i>but they encourage schools and support a respectable
clergy</i>.</p>

<p>In the second place, our ancestors discuvered their
wizdom in establishing public schools and colleges.
The law of Connecticut ordains, that every town, or
parish containing seventy householders, shall keep an
<span class="pb" id="Pg337">[pg 337]</span>
English school, at leest eleven months in a yeer; and
towns containing a less number, at leest six months in
a yeer. Every town keeping a public skool iz entitled
to draw from the trezury of the state, a certain sum
of money, proportioned to its census in the list of property
which furnishes the rule of taxation. This sum
might hav been originally sufficient to support one
skool in each town or parish; but in modern times,
iz divided among a number, and the deficiency of money
to support the skools iz raised upon the estates of
the peeple, in the manner the public taxes are assessed.
To extend the benefits of this establishment to all the
inhabitants, large towns and parishes are divided into
districts; eech of which iz supposed able to furnish a
competent number of skolars for one skool. In eech
district a house iz erected for the purpose by the inhabitants
of that district; who hire a master, furnish
wood, and tax themselves to pay all expenses, not provided
for by the public money. The skool iz kept
during the winter months, when every farmer can spare
hiz sons. In this manner every child in the state haz
access to a school. In the summer, a woman iz hired
to teech small children, who are not fit for any kind of
labor. In the large towns, skools, ether public or
private, are kept the whole yeer; and in every county
town, a grammar school iz established by law.</p>

<p>The state of Massachusetts haz also public schools
on similar principles. The colleges and academies
are too well known to need any description or remarks.</p>

<p>The beneficial effects of theze institutions will be
experienced for ages. Next to the establishments in
favor of religion, they hav been the nurseries of wel-informed
citizens, brave soldiers and wize legislators.
A peeple thus informed are capable of understanding
their rights and of discuvering the meens to secure them.</p>

<p>In the next place, our forefathers took mezures to
prezerve the reputation of skools and the morals of
yuth, by making the business of teeching them an honorable
employment. Every town or district haz a
committee whoze duty iz to procure a master of talents
<span class="pb" id="Pg338">[pg 338]</span>
and karacter; and the practice iz to procure a man
of the best character in the town or naborhood. The
welthy towns apply to yung gentlemen of liberal
education, who, after taking the bachelor's degree,
usually keep skool a yeer or two, before they enter
upon a profession. One of the most unfortunate circumstances
to education in the middle and suthern
states, iz, an opinion that skool keeping iz a meen
employment, fit only for persons of low karacter.
The retches who keep the skools in thoze states, very
frequently degrade the employment; but the misfortune
iz, public opinion suppozes the employment degrades
the man: Of course no gentleman will undertake
to teech children, while, in popular estimation,
he must forfit hiz rank and karacter by the employment.
Until public opinion iz corrected by some great
examples, the common schools, what few there are
in thoze states, must continu in the hands of such vagabonds
az wander about the country.</p>

<p>Neerly connected with the establishment of skools,
iz the circulation of newspapers in New England.
This iz both a consequence and a cause of a general
diffusion of letters. In Connecticut, almost every man
reeds a paper every week. In the yeer 1785, I took
some pains to ascertain the number of papers printed
weekly in Connecticut, and in the suthern states. I
found the number in Connecticut to be neerly eight
thousand; which waz equal to that published in the
whole territory, south of Pensylvania.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" title="During the late war, eight thousand newspapers were published weekly at one press in Hartford." class="fnanchor">[155]</a> By meens of
this general circulation of public papers, the peeple are
informed of all political affairs; and their representativs
are often prepared to deliberate on propositions,
made to the legislature.</p>

<p>Another institution favorable to knowlege, iz the
establishment of parish libraries. Theze are procured
by subscription, but they are numerous, the expense
not being considerable, and the desire of reeding universal.
<span class="pb" id="Pg339">[pg 339]</span>
One hundred volums of books, selected from
the best writers on ethics, divinity and history, and red
by the principal inhabitants of a town or village, wil
hav an amazing influence in spreding knowlege, correcting
the morals and softening the manners of a nation.
I am acquainted with parishes, where almost
every housholder haz red the works of Addison, Sherlock,
Atterbury, Watts, Young, and other similar
writings; and wil converse handsomely on the subjects
of which they treet.</p>

<p>Still further, the wisdom of the erly settlers in New
England iz remarkable in the division of their territorial
jurisdictions into townships, and incorporating them with
certain powers of a subordinate nature. Every town
iz a corporate body, with power to appoint, at an annual
meeting, certain town magistrates, called <i>selectmen</i>,
who hav the charge of providing for the poor, superintending
the town property, dispozing of the monies
&amp;c. rendering an account to the town at the annual
meeting. The towns also appoint constables, <i>collectors
of taxes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" title="This iz an evil of great magnitude." class="fnanchor">[156]</a> surveyors of roads, tithing men, whoze
business iz to prezerve order on Sundays, inspectors of
various denominations, &amp;c. The towns are obliged
to bild and repair their own bridges, repair roads, and
defray the expense by a tax impozed by themselves.
They also support their own poor. This system of
subordinate legislation haz the advantage of saving the
legislature much trubble, and the corporations can
hardly abuse powers, which are limited to their own
territories; nor wil they probably neglect their duty,
az it iz for their interest and convenience to perform it.</p>

<p>In the general organization of guvernment, the New
England states differ widely; thoze of Massachusetts
and New Hampshire, being formed since the revolution,
are wel known; thoze of Connecticut and Rhode Island
are moddled upon the charters of Charles II, and have
suffered but little alteration, since their first establishment.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg340">[pg 340]</span>
The New England colonies were originally guverned
by a cheef magistrate or guvernor, a deputy, and a
certain number of assistants, all chosen by the peeple.
They were called the court of assistants, and for a considerable
time, exercized all powers, legislativ and judicial.
The clergy were uzually associated with them,
and they seem to hav taken cognizance likewise of ecclesiastical
matters. The rulers of peeple in small societies,
in erly settlements, and in the simple state of nature,
uzually hav discretionary powers to act for the
common good. This waz the case with the ancient
witena-gemote, and folk-motes or county meetings
in England; and with the first legislatures in theze colonies.</p>

<p>The towns soon began to send representativs to the
court; but for several yeers in Boston, they sat in the
same house with the assistants; in the same manner az
the knights of shires, or representativs of the inferior
barons, sat in parliament with the lords on their first
introduction into the legislature. But az the towns
multiplied, this practice waz found inconvenient, and
the deputies were separated from the assistants. When
this took place the assistants rezerved to themselves the
judiciary powers, which at first were lodged in the
whole assembly. In Connecticut, the assistants or upper
house of assembly retained theze powers in effect,
till the late revolution; only for the sake of convenience,
five of their number were appointed by both
houses, to the immediate exercize of the office and to
ride the circuit. Still the assembly were a court of appeels
in the last rezort, to all intents and purposes; for
on petition, any judgement or decree might be heerd
and reversed by the legislature. Since the revolution,
a supreme court of errors iz constituted, but on an exceptionable
plan, and the legislature continues to exercize
supreme judicial power on petitions. This iz a
remnant of the old administration, which was once
harmless, if not necessary; but in a large community,
may be considered az a faulty part of the guvernment.
The whole legislature likewise acts az a court for the
<span class="pb" id="Pg341">[pg 341]</span>
trial of public delinquents. This iz an evil of unbounded
magnitude. When charges are exhibited against any
public officer, or any objections made to hiz re-appointment,
he iz admitted to a hearing, council iz employed,
the charges are red, witnesses examined, and the
delinquent makes hiz defence in person or by attorney.
This mode of impeachment and trial iz the worst that
can be invented. It iz difficult or impossible for a
large popular assembly to be good judges; they cannot
perfectly understand a case; they are credulous; and
their compassion eezily moved. A pathetic harang,
especially from the accused himself, with teers in hiz
eyes, and the misfortunes of hiz family painted in discription,
wil skreen from punishment any knave, however
numerous hiz crimes, or however convincing the
proofs of hiz gilt. A popular assembly should not sit
in judgement upon delinquents, for the same reezon
that wimen would be improper judges, and for the same
reezons that the mother and wife of Coriolanus were
the only persons who could save Rome from his vengence.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" title="Uxor deinde ac liberi amplexi; fletusque ab omni turba mulierum ortus, et comploratio sui patriÃ¦que, fregere tandem virum.--Liv. lib ii. 40" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> </p>

<p>The constitution of Connecticut iz if possible, more
defectiv in the trezury or finance department. The
trezurer iz annually appointed by the freemen in the
state at large. This makes him dependent on them.
The collectors are scattered in every part of the state;
and if the trezurer iz not agreeable to them, az he wil
not be, if he iz rigorous in enforcing collections, they
can render him unpopular and throw him out of office.
This iz an evil; besides, the constables, who are collectors,
are appointed by the towns; if they are rigorous
in their duty, they are liable to looz their office;
or what iz worse, they may set up az candidates for the
legislature, and by an influence arizing from their power
in exacting taxes with a greater or less degree of rigor,
procure an election to an employment for which
<span class="pb" id="Pg342">[pg 342]</span>
they are wholly unqualified. When a considerable
number of collectors hav obtained seets in the legislature,
they are ever reddy to delay or suspend the collection
of taxes. This iz not the worst part of the system.
The method of obtaining the money in default of the
collectors, iz tedious, expensiv, ineffectual, and in short
ridiculous. When a collector iz in arreer, a distress
issues from the trezury against hiz estate. Upon a return
of <i>non est</i>, or in case of the collector's insolvency,
execution issues against the selectmen of the town,
whose estates are liable for the arreerages of taxes.
The selectmen then levy a tax upon the inhabitants to
indemnify themselves.</p>

<p>It would be endless to enumerate the evils arizing
out of this mode of collection. If the trezurer was
appointed by the legislature, with power to name his
collectors and call them to account; and if collectors
were obliged to giv bonds with sufficient security to
save the state from loss, which security should be liable
to distress immediately on failure of the collector,
the taxes would be collected with promptitude and a
great saving of expense.</p>

<p>It may be obzerved, that the faults of the constitution
are ascribeable to the ancient simplicity of the New
England peeple, and the corruptions of the administration
hav grown out of the long tranquillity of the state.
While the peeple had perfect confidence in their rulers,
they were not disposed to disobey the laws; and while
there were few opportunities of corruptions, there might
be no instance of maladministration, so obvious or atrocious
az to alarm enquiry, and excite peeple to change
laws and forms, to which they had been familiarized.
The inconveniencies resulting from a union of the legislativ
and judicial powers in the same hands, were
not so great az to be sensibly felt by the public; and
habits of respect for men in office, and submission to
law, had rendered men credulous and unsuspecting.
To this day, it iz difficult to make the inhabitants beleev
that their rulers and magistrates can betray a public
trust. Till within two yeers, the guvernor, deputy
guvernor, judges of the superior court, or two justices
<span class="pb" id="Pg343">[pg 343]</span>
of the peece, could draw upon the trezury of Connecticut,
without their accounts being examined by any
controller or auditor.</p>

<p>Before the legislature could be persuaded to institute
a controller's office az a check upon the trezury, it
waz necessary to exhibit to them strong proofs of maladministration
in that department; and the evils arizing
from the prezent mode of collecting taxes, must
be obvious and great, before they wil make any change
in the system. Men are guverned by habit. The first
laws of a country take their complection from the peculiar
cast and circumstances of the peeple; and then the
laws in turn contribute to form the manners of succeeding
generations. The state of Connecticut iz an
illustrious example of this truth. By its situation, it
can never be expozed to sudden changes by an influx
of foreigners. It haz no great capital, no general mart
where all business centers; it haz very little intercourse
with Europe; and the communication by water between
New York and Rhode Island iz so direct, eezy
and cheep, that for nine months in the yeer, few peeple
travel thro Connecticut. For theze reezons, ancient
manners and habits will be prezerved longer in this
state than in most of the others.</p>

<p>There iz one article in the constitution of this state
that merits notice and imitation, because it iz equally
singular and excellent. It iz the manner of electing
the assistants or senators of their own legislature, and
the members of congress. Theze are elected by the
freemen at large in the whole state. The number of
senators iz twelve, and chosen annually in this manner.
In September, the <i>freemen</i> assemble in the towns and
vote for twenty persons, by ballot; the votes are all
returned to the legislature in October, and numbered;
and the twenty names that hav the most votes are said
to stand in <i>nomination</i>, and are published by order of
assembly. The next April, the freemen assemble again,
and vote by ballot for <i>twelv</i> of the <i>twenty</i>, and the
<i>twelv</i> persons who hav the most votes, are elected. Representatives
in congress are chozen in a similar manner.
The great excellence of this mode of choozing
<span class="pb" id="Pg344">[pg 344]</span>
iz, it holds up to public view, six months before election,
the karacters who are candidates; peeple hav an
opportunity of enquiring into their merits, that they
may select from the whole thoze who are the leest exceptionable.</p>

<p>It iz also a singular advantage that one branch of the
legislature stands upon the suffrages of the whole. If
a man's nabors take a dislike to hiz public or private
conduct, they wil, if possible, dismiss him from office.
This iz the great misfortune of small district elections,
for it often happens that a man's integrity and independence
in public mezures, are most likely to render
him unpopular among hiz nabors; and sometimes
small domestic occurrences may turn the tide of favor
against him. But when a man iz elected by a large
district, he iz not expozed to this evil; and nothing
short of a general opposition to popular mezures will
shake him from hiz elevation. Theze remarks hav
been repeetedly verified in Connecticut. The independence
of the senate, owing mostly to this article in
the constitution, haz several times saved the state from
the most disgraceful acts.</p>

<p>The representativs are chozen twice a yeer, for there
are two regular sessions of the legislature. This iz an
inconvenience, but not so great, az it appears to our
suthern nabors; for the freemen meet in towns, which
are but about six miles square; so that they can go
from home, make a choice, and return in three hours.</p>

<p>The regularity of theze meetings iz incredible to
strangers, accustomed to the tumultuous elections in
England and the suthern states. No man dare solicit
for the votes of hiz nabors, nor ever offers himself a
candidate by advertizing. The freemen meet in some
public bilding, uzually a church, seet themselves, heer
the law red respecting elections, and proclamation iz
made that they prepare their ballots for the officer to be
chozen. The constables then carry a hat to every
freeman and take the votes, which are counted by the
civil authority, and the choice declared in the meeting.
Thus the representativs are elected; but the ballots
<span class="pb" id="Pg345">[pg 345]</span>
for guvernor, deputy guvernor, senators, and delegates
to congress, are seeled up, and sent to Hartford, where
they are numbered at the annual election in May. The
choice iz conducted with neerly the same sobriety az
public worship on Sunday. How different the elections
in the suthern states, where I hav seen candidates
march at the hed of their adherents, armed with clubs,
and force their way to the place of election, and by violence
thrusting away their rivals! It is a misfortune
in thoze states, that the freemen of a <i>whole county</i> assemble
at elections. This iz one principal cause, why
the elections are attended with tumults, riots, quarrels,
bloody nozes, and in a few instances, with deth. The
laws of a republic should gard against all large collections
of peeple either for good or bad purposes: They are
always dangerous. Rome furnishes innumerable lessons
on this subject; and if the suthern legislatures attend
to facts, they wil doubtless divide their counties
into small districts for the purpose of election, and hav
the choice completed in one day; that the candidates
might not be able to hed their frends in more places
than one. It iz of infinit consequence that the pernicious
influence of elections should be destroyed.</p>

<p>Religion in Connecticut haz the support of law.
Contracts with clergymen are valid in law, and every
man iz compelled to pay hiz proportion of taxes to
pay the salary of the minister of the parish where he
resides, unless he produces du proof that he attends
worship with some dissenting congregation; in which
case he iz excuzed. This iz considered by strangers
az a hardship: But it produces few inconveniencies in
a state where there are few dissenters from the common
worship; and theze few are exempted, if they attend
<i>any</i> religious worship. Every person iz indulged in
worshiping az he pleezes; and whatever modern liberality
may pretend, the regular preeching of the gospel,
az a <i>civil</i> institution, iz az necessary and useful, az the
establishment of skools or courts of justice. Without
any regard to compulsion over consciences, or any reference
to a future life, a legal provision for the moral instructors
<span class="pb" id="Pg346">[pg 346]</span>
of men, iz az beneficial in society, az any civil
or literary institution whatever; and a commonalty,
who hav not the benefit of such instruction, wil, I presume
to assert, always be ignorant, and of ruf uncivil
manners. It iz an article of some constitutions in
America, that clergymen shal hold no civil office.
This exclusion iz founded on just az good reezons, az
the old laws against witchcraft; a clergyman being no
more dangerous in a civil office, than a witch in civil
society. It iz said that the business of clergymen iz
divine and spiritual, and that they should hav no concern
with politics. The objection iz equally good
against merchants, mechanics and farmers, who hav no
immediate concern with legislation. The truth iz, every
citizen haz a concern in the laws which guvern
him; and a clergyman haz the same concern with
civil laws, az other men. There hav been bad clergymen
and tyrannical hierarkies in the world; but the error
lies in separating the civil from the ecclesiastical government.
When separated they become rivals; when
united, they hav the same interest to pursu. A clergyman's
business iz to <i>inform</i> hiz peeple, and to make
them <i>good men</i>. This iz the way to make them <i>good
citizens</i>. The clergymen in Boston take the right
method to accomplish this business; they throw aside
all <i>divine airs</i> and imperious grave superiority; they
mingle in the most familiar manner, with other peeple;
they are social and facetious, and their parishoners delight
to hav them at all entertainments and concerts.
This conduct remoovs the awful distance between
them and other descriptions of men; they are not only
esteemed and respected, but luved; their decent deportment
iz imitated; their churches are crowded, and
their instructions listened to with plezure. Such men
are blessings to society. That clergymen ought not to
meddle with politics, iz so far from truth, that they
ought to be <i>well</i> acquainted with the subject, and <i>better</i>
than most classes of men, in proportion to their literary
attainments. Religion and policy ought ever to go
hand in hand; not to raize a system of despotism over
<span class="pb" id="Pg347">[pg 347]</span>
the consciences, but to enlighten the minds, soften the
harts, correct the manners and restrain the vices of
men. If men are to be fitted for heaven, it <i>must</i> be by
theze meens; there iz no other way. The separation
of religion and policy, of church and state, waz owing
at first to the errors of a gloomy superstition, which exalted
the ministers of Christ into Deities; who, like
other men, under similar advantages, became tyrants.
The way to check their ambition, and to giv full efficacy
to their administrations, iz to consider them az
<i>men</i> and <i>citizens</i>, entitled to all the benefits of guvernment,
subject to law, and designed for <i>civil</i> az wel az
<i>spiritual</i> instructors.</p>

<p>The state of New York waz settled with views,
widely different from thoze which actuated the New
England puritans. Some Dutch merchants first established
factories at Albany and on Manhattans, now
York Island, for the purpose of opening a fur trade.
When the province came into the possession of the
English, several gentlemen of property took up large
tracts of lands, which, being regulated by the English
laws of descent, continued unbroken, til the late revolution.
But many of the proprietors of theze manors,
espousing the royal cause in the late contest, left
their estates, which were of course confiscated and sold
by the state. This circumstance waz fatal to many
large manors; and a law of the state, enacted about
the yeer 1781, which breaks the present and bars all
future entailments, wil in time divide the large estates
which remain unbroken. The Dutch possess the most
fertile parts of the old settlements; az Ulster and
Claverak counties, part of Albany and Kings county,
on Long Island. They are honest and economical,
but indolent, and destitute of enterprize; so that the
state wil be mostly indetted to emigrants from New
England, for its future population and improvements.</p>

<p>New York city iz the most favorable stand for a
great commercial port on the united states. Men may
indulge themselves in rapsodies, about the Potomack,
the Ohio and the Missisippi; but no part of theze
<span class="pb" id="Pg348">[pg 348]</span>
states, eest of the Allegany, wil ever rival New York,
and it iz doutful whether the same conveniencies for
business unite on any part of the Missisippi. New York
iz the center of the commerce of all the territory, between
the western boundary of Rhode Island and the
middle of New Jersey, from the Atlantic neerly to the
borders of Canada; a district of two hundred miles by
two hundred and fifty. And the geography of the
country tells us, that no part of Atlantic America can
claim the same extensiv advantages. New York iz
not eezily defended in time of war, and therefore,
without a navy, iz not a safe place for an arsenal; but
West Point, sixty miles abuv the city, on the Hudson,
iz the most impregnable fortress in America.</p>

<p>Before the revolution, the guvernment of New York
waz under the influence of the crown of Great Britain,
the guvernor and council being appointed by the king.
It waz illiberal in the preference given to the episcopal
church; no other denomination of Christians being able
to obtain any corporate establishment. The same
illiberal preference waz discuverable in the institution
and guvernment of the college, now called Columbia
college, in which dissenters of any description could not
hav a share. The revolution haz effected a change in
theze particulars. Dissenting churches, which are the
most numerous in the state, are or may be incorporated;
and education begins to be encuraged by the laws.
A university iz established, with a power of superintending
and regulating skools throughout the state; but
provision iz not made for maintaining common skools
in every quarter of the state. Ignorance stil prevails
among the yemanry; and this enables certain designing
karacters to exercise a pernicious influence in the
guvernment.</p>

<p>The territory of New Jersey originally belonged to
two, and afterwards to many proprietors, who appointed
the guvernors. But in the reign of queen Ann, the
guvernment waz resigned to the crown, and for a
number of yeers, the guvernor of New York waz also
guvernor of the Jersies, altho eech province had a <ins class="err" title="district" id="E349">distinct</ins>
<span class="pb" id="Pg349">[pg 349]</span>
assembly. The heirs of the original proprietors,
or their purchasers, stil hold the soil. There are in this
state many large estates, but an entailment iz good only
to the first donee in tail; the estate, on hiz deth intestate,
being divided equally among hiz heirs. In
general the laws of New Jersey are highly republican;
but they make no provision for a general diffusion of
knowlege. Many of the yemanry are extremely ignorant.
The college at Princeton iz a very valuable
institution; but so little concern haz the legislature for
the interest of lerning, that the funds of that college are
taxed by law.</p>

<p>The present constitution of New Jersey iz liable to
few exceptions; but the state iz divided into two parties
which often agitate the guvernment. Az the cause
and effects of the controversy which began and stil
continues theze parties, are little known to their nabors,
I beg leev here to offer a concise state of the facts from
unquestionable authority.</p>

<p>James, duke of York, in June 1664, conveyed New
Jersey to John, lord Berkeley, and Sir George Carteret,
in fee. The bounds of the territory granted were, the
main see and Hudson's river on the eest, Delaware bay
or river on the west, Cape May on the south, and on
the north <i>the northernmost branch of Delaware bay, or
river, which iz forty one degrees and forty minutes of latitude,
crossing over thence in strait line to Hudson's river,
in forty one degrees of latitude</i>.</p>

<p>Some intermediate conveyances of lord Berkeley's
undivided half part were made, but need not be here
recited. On the first of July, 1676, waz executed a
quintipartite deed, between Sir George Carteret, and the
grantees of lord Berkely, by which the territory waz divided;
Sir George Carteret releesing all the western
part to the grantees of Berkeley, and the latter releesing
the eestern part to Sir George. The line of partition,
which originated all the subsequent disputes, iz thus
described in the deed: "Extending eestward and
northward along the see coast and the said river, called
Hudson's river, from the eest side of a certain place or
<span class="pb" id="Pg350">[pg 350]</span>
harbor, lying on the suthern part of the same tract of
land, and commonly called and known in a <ins class="err" title="mass" id="E350">map</ins> of the
same, by the name of <i>Little Egg Harbor</i>, to that part
of the said Hudson's river, which iz in forty one degrees
of latitude, being the furthermost part of said
tract of land and premises, which iz bounded by the
said river, and crossing over from thence in a strait line,
extending from that part of Hudson's river aforesaid,
to the northernmost part or branch of the before mentioned
river, called Delaware river, and to the most
northerly point or boundary of the said tract of land
and premises, granted by hiz royal highness, James,
duke of York, to lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret."</p>

<p>A difficulty aroze about the northern point of partition;
the duke of York's grant making the northernmost
branch of Delaware bay or river to be in <i>forty one
degrees and forty minutes</i> of latitude; and declaring a
line from this point to the latitude of <i>forty one</i> on Hudson's
river, to be the northern boundary of New Jersey.
Disputes aroze, and the legislature of New Jersey, in
1719, passed an act, declaring that a partition line between
Eest and West Jersey, shall be run <i>from the most
northerly point or boundary of the province, on the northernmost
branch of Delaware river</i>, to the most sutherly
point of Little Egg Harbor. Commissioners were appointed
for this purpose, and also for running the line
between New York and New Jersey. They met with
commissioners from New York, but could not agree,
and left the business unfinished. In 1741, another attempt
waz made by Mr. Alexander, surveyor general
of both divisions, but obnoxious to the West Jersey
proprietors. He began to run the line, but some errors
he committed, or bad instruments, prevented the
completion of the business; he stopped half way. Disputes
ran high, and were attended with riots, till the
yeers 1762 and 1764, when by a law of New York and
another of New Jersey, it waz agreed the line between
the provinces should be run by commissioners to be appointed
by the crown. To this agreement the proprietors
<span class="pb" id="Pg351">[pg 351]</span>
of West Jersey az well az Eest, were parties.
The commissioners met, fixed the two station points
between New York and New Jersey, one at a rock on
Hudson's river, in forty one degrees of latitude, the
other at the forks of the Delaware, at the mouth of the
river Makhakamak, in latitude 41Â°. 21'. 37". This
point on Delaware iz <i>eighteen minutes twenty three seconds</i>,
to the suthward of the <i>northern boundary</i> of New
Jersey, az described in the duke of York's grant to the
first proprietors; which waz, on the <i>northernmost branch
of Delaware river, which iz forty one degrees forty minutes</i>
of latitude.</p>

<p>Both parties appeeled to the crown, but without success.
Acts were afterwards passed, both by New York
and New Jersey, confirming the line between the provinces,
and theze acts receeved the approbation of the
king in council. This waz an amicable settlement between
the two provinces; and it waz expected that the
<i>northern limits of New Jersey</i> and the <i>station points</i> on
both rivers, being fixed by law, nothing waz necessary
to quiet all parties, but to run the line from the north
station point on Delaware to Little Egg Harbor.</p>

<p>A correspondence for this purpose took place between
the proprietors of Eest and West Jersey; but before
the matter waz completed the war commenced. Since
the war, the controversies hav been revived, and divided
the state into violent parties. It seems the proprietors
of Eest Jersey expected the <i>north station point on
Delaware</i> would hav been fixed az high az <i>forty one degrees
forty minutes</i>, the point described by the original
grant from the duke of York. This would hav carried
the limit of the state about eighteen miles further
north on the Delaware side. Now there iz a bend in
the Delaware, at the forks, so that the station point az
now fixed, iz carried further eest than it would be, had
it been fixed in <i>forty one degrees forty minutes</i>; so the
decision of the commissioners waz in favor of the West
Jersey proprietors. From the forks, the river bends
its course westerly of north, and from a point eighteen
miles north, a line to Little Egg Harbor, would leev an
<span class="pb" id="Pg352">[pg 352]</span>
angle containing several thousand akers of land, in Eest
Jersey. This iz a short state of the origin and progress
of a controversy, which stil agitates the state and disturbs
the peece of their guvernment; the jealousies between
Eest and West Jersey being almost az great az
between the northern and suthern states, upon a question
respecting the seet of guvernment, or any other
matter of little consequence to the union. The contest
however iz of magnitude to both parties in New
Jersey, az the lands in dispute hav been settled upon
doutful titles; and altho an act of the legislature may
establish theze, yet the loozing party wil expect a compensation.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" title="The foregoing facts are taken from Leaming and Spicer's Collection; a concise view of the controversy, &amp;c. published in 1785; and from the acts of the legislature of New Jersey." class="fnanchor">[158]</a> </p>

<p>The commerce of New Jersey iz almost wholly carried
on thro New York and Philadelphia. Its situation,
between two large commercial towns, resembles
that of Connecticut; but in one respect, the latter haz
the advantage, viz. that of a butiful navigable river,
penetrating the state and affording the best conveniences
for a trade to the West Indies. The legislature of
New Jersey hav attempted to call home the trade of the
state, by holding out liberal encouragement for direct
importations from abroad, and making free ports.
Perth Amboy affords a fine harbor, but it iz difficult,
perhaps impossible, to raize a rival in the naborhood of
New York. New Jersey and Connecticut wil find
their interest in encuraging manufactures.</p>

<p>Pensylvania waz settled by a religious sect, remarkable
for their sobriety, industry and pacific disposition.
Mr. Penn, the first proprietor of the province, waz a
man of superior talents. The free indulgence given to
all religious denominations, invited settlers from England,
Germany and Ireland, and the population of the
province, with the consequential increese of the valu of
lands, waz rapid beyond any thing known in the other
colonies. The province however waz harrassed with
disputes between the acting guvernors and the commons.
<span class="pb" id="Pg353">[pg 353]</span>
The proprietary, who waz the guvernor, usually
rezided in England; appointing a deputy with a
council, to act for him in the province. The proprietaries
were often selfish, and made demands upon the
peeple, which their sense of liberty and right would not
permit them to grant. The quit-rents, paper currency,
and some other matters, were constant subjects of
altercation, whenever the assembly convened.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" title="See Dr. Franklins Review of the guvernment of Pensylvania." class="fnanchor">[159]</a> </p>

<p>The long and violent opposition to the influence of
their proprietaries, who were abroad, and often considered
az hostile to popular privileges, together with the
beneficial effects of a paper currency, during the infant
state of the province, may be the reezons why the constitution
of Pensylvania, formed at the revolution, verged
too much towards an extreme of democracy;<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" title="The powers of legislation by the late constitution, were designed to be vested in the peeple; but in fact were vested no where. The pretended legislature consisted of but one house; and no bill, except on pressing occasions, could be passed into a law, until it had been published for the assent of the peeple." class="fnanchor">[160]</a> and
why the legislature of that state waz the first to issue a
paper currency, after the war. The old republican
patriots, who had resisted, with success, the encroachments
of arbitrary guvernors and kings, determined to
frame a constitution, which should prevent the interference
of a guvernor and council in acts of legislation;
and men who had seen the <i>good</i> effects of paper currency,
without its <i>evils</i>, would be the first to recommend
it. It iz natural; men are guverned by habit.</p>

<p>At the revolution in 1776, the representativs of
the province, acting on the principle that public good
transcends all considerations of individual right, assumed
the reigns of government, formed a constitution
for the purpose, and divested the proprietaries of both
territory and jurisdiction. They gave them however,
130,000l. sterling in lieu of all quit-rents, and rezerved
to them considerable tracts of land. The first constitution,
like that of the Netherlands, waz framed upon
<span class="pb" id="Pg354">[pg 354]</span>
the ruins of oppression, and with a too jealous attention
to popular rights. It waz defectiv in the most
material articles, and a few yeers experience induced
the peeple to adopt another form, more analagous to
thoze by which her sister states are guverned.</p>

<p>The laws of Pensylvania, respecting inheritances,
hav not barred entails; but az entails may be docked
by the English finesse of common recoveries; az the
divisions of lands favor equality, az wel az the genius
of the peeple, there can be no apprehensions of an aristocratical
influence from large possessions of real estate.
A single man may hold real or personal estate to such
an amount, az to hav an undu influence in politics and
commerce. When a man haz become so powerful
that hiz nabors are afraid to demand their rights of
him in a legal way; or when a town or city iz so far
under hiz control, that the citizens are generally afraid
of offending him, he iz or may be a dangerous man
in a free state, and a <i>bad</i> man in any state. A Clive
and a Hastings are az dangerous in a state, az an Arnold
or a Shays, if they hav the same evil propensities; for
thoze who oppoze law, are generally punished; but
thoze who are abuv law, may do injustice with impunity.</p>

<p>The peeple in Pensylvania may be included under
the three denominations of <i>Frends</i>, <i>Germans</i>, and <i>Irish
desendants</i>. The <i>Frends</i> and <i>Germans</i> were the first settlers,
and for the most part liv between the Delaware and
Susquehanna. Theze are peeceable and industrious
peeple. The Irish or their desendants, inhabit the
western counties; they are industrious, but not so wel
informed in general, az the inhabitants of some older
counties, and at times hav been turbulent citizens. It
waz the misfortune of this, az of all the suthern states,
that no provision for public skools waz incorporated
into the original fundamental laws.</p>

<p>Without such a provision, it iz not possible that a
body of freemen should hav the reeding necessary to
form just notions of liberty and law. This defect wil
probably be supplied by the new constitution and the
<span class="pb" id="Pg355">[pg 355]</span>
future laws of the state. The number of colleges and
academies alreddy founded and endowed, proov the disposition
of the legislature to encurage science. The
only difficulty iz to persuade an agricultural peeple to
settle in villages or <ins class="err" title="ilans" id="E355">clans</ins>, for the purpose of maintaining
a clergyman and skoolmaster; and thus to carry into
effect the wise and benevolent designs of their rulers.</p>

<p>Philadelphia iz a great commercial city; but it iz
questioned whether commerce wil giv it a future growth
equal to that of New York. The future population
of the suthern part of New Jersey, and the peninsula
between the Chesapeek and the Atlantic, wil not add
much to the trade of Philadelphia. The naborhood
of the city and most of the lands towards Lancaster
and Bethlehem, are alreddy wel settled. About seventy
three miles west of Philadelphia runs the Susquehanna;
a river not indeed navigable at the mouth, but
with some portages, capable of opening a communication
by water from Wioming to the Chesapeek; and
should canals be opened to avoid the falls and rapids,
the trade of the state, quite to the bed of that river, wil
center in Baltimore. At any rate Baltimore and Alexandria
wil command most of the trade west of the Susquehanna;
so that Philadelphia must depend mostly,
for the increese of her business, on the population
northward, about the hed of the Deleware. The commerce
however wil always be considerable, and the
spirit of the citizens in establishing manufactures, promises
a great extension of the city.</p>

<p>The state of Pensylvania waz, for many yeers, agitated
by a territorial controversy with Connecticut; the
history of which iz breefly this.</p>

<p>King James I. in 1620, made a grant to a number
of gentlemen, called the <i>Plimouth Company</i>, of all the
lands in North America, included between the 40th and
48th degrees of latitude, <i>throughout all the main land from
see to see</i>; except such lands az were then settled by
some Christian prince or state. The only settlements
at that time north of Virginia, were at New York and
Albany, on the Hudson.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg356">[pg 356]</span>
In 1628, a number of gentlemen obtained from the
company a grant of lands, bounded on the north, by a
line three miles north of Merrimak river, and on the
south, by a line three miles south of Charles river,
<i>throughout the main lands from the Atlantic on the eest, to
the South See, on the west</i>. This waz the first grant of
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>In the yeer 1631, Robert, erl of Warwick, president
of the Plimouth company, granted to lord Say and
Seal, and lord Brook, all that part of New England,
extending from Naraganset river, the space of forty
leegs on a strait line, neer the see coast, north and south
in latitude and bredth, and in length and longitude of
and within all the aforesaid bredth, <i>throughout all the
main lands from the western Ocean to the South See</i>. This
grant waz confirmed by the charter of Charles II.
dated April 23, 1662, with a similar description of the
territory.</p>

<p>In 1664, king Charles II. gave hiz brother a tract of
land in America, the description of which iz not wholly
consistent or intelligible; but one part of the grant
interfered with the Connecticut patent, and disputes
aroze, which were amicably settled by commissioners in
1683; the line between Connecticut and New York
being fixed at Byram river, about twenty miles eest of
the Hudson.</p>

<p>In 1680, Sir William Penn obtained from the crown
a tract of land, extending from twelv miles north of New
Castle, on the Delaware, to the forty third degree of latitude,
and from the Delaware westward five degrees of
longitude. This grant interfered with the patent of Connecticut,
provided the grant to the guvernor and company
of Connecticut should be extended west of New
York, according to the words of that and the other grants
of New England. Mr. Penn took care to gain a just
title to hiz patent by bona fide purchases of the Indians,
who possessed the soil. But the question iz, whether
he had a right of pre-emption to lands before granted to
other men; and whether the king's grant to him could
be valid, so far az it cuvered lands alredy conveyed by
<span class="pb" id="Pg357">[pg 357]</span>
the crown to a company, which had begun settlements
upon the grant.</p>

<p>The Pensylvanians contended that, the geografy of
this country being little known in England, az all the
maps and charts at that time were imperfect and erroneous,
it must hav been owing to an ignorance of the
distance from the Atlantic to the South See, that the
grants were made to run thro the continent: That
Mr. Penn had acquired the best of titles to the lands
in dispute by fair purchase from the nativ proprietors:
And that Connecticut, by a settlement of her boundary
with New York, had fixed her western limits, and relinquished
all claim to lands west of New York.</p>

<p>While any part of Connecticut, eest of New York,
remained unlocated, the inhabitants suffered their
claims westward to lie dormant. But about the yeer
1750, the whole of this territory waz located, and the
peeple began to think of forming a settlement west of
Delaware river. They however knew that the lands
were claimed by Pensylvania, and to remoov all douts
az to the validity of their own title, requested the opinions
of the most eminent council in England, upon
their right by charter to the lands in question. They
receeved for answer, that the grant to the Plimouth
company, did extend to the westward of New York:
That the settlement of the boundary line between
New York and Connecticut, did not affect their claims
to lands in other parts: And that, the charter of Connecticut
being of a prior date to that of Sir William
Penn, there waz no ground to contend, that the crown
could make an effectual grant to him of that country
which had been so recently granted to others. This
answer waz so decisiv and cleer in favor of their claim,
that they proceeded to locate and settle the lands on
the Susquehanna river, within the latitude of the Connecticut
charter. It seems however that a few scattering
settlements had been made within the same latitude,
on the opposit side of the river, under Pensylvania locations.
The settlers soon came to an open quarrel, and
both states became interested in the controversy. The
<span class="pb" id="Pg358">[pg 358]</span>
dispute however subsided a few yeers during the war,
til finally both states submitted their claims to the <i>jurisdiction
of the territory</i>, to a federal court, which waz
held at Trenton, in November, 1782. The decision
of this court waz in favor of Pensylvania, and Connecticut
acquiesced.</p>

<p>Dissatisfied with this decree, the settlers under Connecticut
and individual claimants, determined to maintain
their <i>right to the soil</i>, which they had possessed more
than twenty five yeers; and to submit this also to a federal
court. No court however waz ever held for the purpose;
the claimants not finding any support from the
guvernment of Connecticut. The settlers, amounting
to many hundreds, remained upon the soil. Pensylvania,
by a precipitancy arising out of an imperfect
frame of guvernment, resolved to take possession of the
lands, and sent an armed force for the purpose. This
mezure waz rash, especially az the principal settlers
had taken the oath of allegiance to that state, and were
willing, if they could be quieted in their possessions, to
becum good and peeceable citizens. Tumults followed;
the history of which would be disagreeable to most
reeders. At length, Pensylvania passed a law to quiet
thoze who were actual settlers before the decree at
Trenton, in the possession of their farms, amounting to
about three hundred akers eech. The territory waz
erected into a county, by the name of Luzerne, in
honor of the French minister of that name. Colonel
Pickering waz appointed Prothonotary<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" title="Clerk or register." class="fnanchor">[161]</a> of the county.
This gentleman haz suffered much in reconciling parties;
but hiz integrity, zeel, prudence, and indefatigable
industry, bid fair to meet with merited success in
quieting disorders and establishing guvernment.</p>

<p>In this controversy, several questions arize. First,
What right had the crown of England to the lands in
North America?</p>

<p>I answer, the <i>right of discuvery</i>. This right, however
the law of nations may hav considered it, does
not in fact entitle a prince or state to the soil, even of
<span class="pb" id="Pg359">[pg 359]</span>
an uninhabited territory; much less, of lands possessed
by any of the human race. It entitles the discuvering
nation to a preference in forming settlements or occupying
vacant lands. And this right iz derived rather
from the common convenience of nations, or the necessity
of some principle by which to prevent controversy,
than from any connection between <i>discuvery</i> and
a <i>title to property</i>.</p>

<p>Secondly, What right could the grantees derive from
a royal grant of lands in America?</p>

<p>I answer, merely a <i>right of pre-emption</i>, or a preference
in purchasing the lands of the proprietors, the nativ
Indians.</p>

<p>Thirdly, The guvernor and company of Connecticut,
by the prior date of their charter, having the right
of pre-emption to all the lands cuvered by the charter,
could Mr. Penn acquire a title to any of the same lands
by pre-emption?</p>

<p>On legal principles he certainly could not.</p>

<p>The only substantial ground of title which Pensylvania
could hav to the controverted lands, waz, that
Connecticut, by neglecting to purchase of the Indians,
might forfit their right of pre-emption, and leev the
territory open to any purchaser whatever; so that Mr.
Penn or hiz heirs might acquire a good title by first
purchase. Whether Mr. Penn actually acquired such a
title or not, I am not possessed of documents to decide.
That the first grant of New England actually extended
to the Western or Pacific Ocean, cannot be denied;
and congress hav admitted the claim, by accepting from
Connecticut a cession of lands west of Pensylvania.
Connecticut however stil holds a tract of one hundred
and twenty miles, west of that state, which iz now for
sale. The state of Massachusetts haz a similar claim to
lands west of New York state; and the line between
the two states haz lately been settled by commissioners.
At any rate, the controversy between Connecticut and
Pensylvania waz finally terminated by the decree of
Trenton, and it iz to be wished no future altercation
may disturb the states or individual proprietors.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg360">[pg 360]</span>
The small state of Delaware resembles Pensylvania
in respect to its history and guvernment.</p>

<p>Maryland waz settled by Roman Catholic emigrants,
from England and Ireland, under lord Baltimore.
Large grants of land were carved out to individuals,
and slaves purchased from Africa to cultivate the soil.
Some of the largest estates in America lie in Maryland.
The guvernment waz formerly in the hands of the
proprietary; but the peeple, at the revolution, assumed
it. Mr. Harford, the natural son of lord Baltimore,
inherited hiz property in Maryland; but being an absentee
during the war, hiz estates were confiscated, and
on petition, the legislature refuzed him even the arreerages
of rent, du at the commencement of hostilities.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" title="See the proceedings of the legislature of Maryland in 1785." class="fnanchor">[162]</a> </p>

<p>The present constitution iz in general excellent; and
particularly in the establishment of an independent
senate. In a popular state, nothing contributes so
much to stability and safety, az an independency and
firmness in one branch of the legislature. This state
however, like its nabors, iz remarkable for tumultuous
elections; a malpractice that haz existed from its first
settlement; a practice which wil sooner or later proov
fatal to the attempts of merit in obtaining offices, and
sap the foundation of a free guvernment.</p>

<p>The body of the peeple are ignorant. I once saw a
copy of instructions given to a representativ by hiz constituents,
with more than a hundred names subscribed;
three fifths of which were marked with a cross, because
the men could not write. Two or three colleges, and
some academies and private skools, constitute the principal
meens of instruction in this state, and most of
theze are of a modern establishment. A few large towns
only giv good encuragement to skools and the clergy.</p>

<p>Maryland continues to receev multitudes of emigrants
from Europe, and many of them are of the
poorest class. From several months rezidence in Maryland,
I am inclined to beleev, there are more vagabonds
<span class="pb" id="Pg361">[pg 361]</span>
in Baltimore and the vicinity, than in all New England.
But Maryland must decide upon the public
benefit derived from this unrestrained admission of
foreigners.</p>

<p>Virginia waz settled <i>eight</i> yeers before New York,
and <i>fourteen</i> before New England. This circumstance
haz given the state the quaint appellation of the <i>ancient
dominion</i>. The divisions of property are large, and the
lands cultivated by slaves. Entailments of land were
barred before the revolution; but real estate iz not liable
for det upon an execution. It appeers strange at first
view, that men should exempt their lands from this
liability, and at the same time, suffer their persons to be
imprizoned for det: The singularity however iz eezily
accounted for, by their karacteristic attachment to <i>large
estates</i>, or rather to the <i>name</i> of possessing them. When
a man's consequence and reputation depend principally
on the quantity of land and number of negroes <i>he iz
said to possess</i>, he will not risk both for the sake of hiz
creditors. The passion for the <i>name of a planter</i>, absorbs
all other considerations. I waz once present at
an entertainment, given by a <i>yung planter</i> in Virginia,
who had <i>much land</i> and <i>many slaves</i>. He aroze at two
o'clock next morning, pawned hiz knee buckles and
some other articles, gave hiz landlord a note for about
sixty dollars, and rode off without paying hiz hair-dresser.
But he waz <i>said</i> to be a man of property. Many
of the planters are indeed nominally rich; but their
dets are not paid. I waz told by wel informed planters,
that some whole counties in Virginia would hardly
sel for the valu of the dets du from the inhabitants.
The Virginians, it iz tru, owe immense sums to British
merchants, and the difficulty of paying them might be
a principal reezon for suspending the collection by law,
at the cloze of the war; but that the real estates of a
whole county would not discharge the dets of it, iz not
to be beleeved.</p>

<p>A large part of the peeple in Virginia hav not the
meens of education. The dispersed situation of the
planters in the suthern states, renders it impossible for
<span class="pb" id="Pg362">[pg 362]</span>
all to hav access to skools. The university of Williamsburg,
and a few academies in large towns, constitute
the principal meens of education in Virginia; and
the same remark iz applicable to all the suthern states.
But a small proportion of the white children can reep
any advantage from theze institutions. Since the revolution,
the legislatures of all the suthern states hav
shown a dispozition to giv liberal encuragement to the
education of every rank of citizens; but the local circumstances
or habits of the peeple throw innumerable
obstacles in the way of executing their patriotic designs.
Gentlemen of property, reziding on their plantations
at a distance from a village, wil sometimes hire
a private instructor in their families; but theze instructors
must be vagabonds, for the most part; az the
gentlemen wil not admit that a <i>skoolmaster</i> can be a <i>gentleman</i>;
in consequence of which opinion, most or all
teechers are excluded from genteel company. While
this iz the case, men of good breeding wil not be found
to teech their children. An exception must be made
of <i>grammar masters</i>, az they are called; for a man who
can teech Latin, they suppoze, may be a <i>decent</i> man,
and fit for gentlemen's company.</p>

<p>Religion fares worse in Virginia than education.
Before the war, the episcopal waz the established religion
of the province, and the churches were liberally
endowed by law. A parish usually contained four
churches, in eech of which a clergyman officiated in
rotation, one Sunday in a month. But this greevous
burthen waz remooved by the revolution, and great
numbers of parishes hav no officiating minister. A
motion waz brot forward in 1785, to make some legal
provizion for supporting clergymen; but the proposition
waz suspended til the next session of the legislature.
In the meen time a pompous retorical memorial waz
circulated and subscribed, in oppozition to the mezure.
The arguments uzed against any ecclesiastical establishments
were splendid, <i>liberal</i> and efficacious; and at
the following session, the legislature passed a declaratory
<span class="pb" id="Pg363">[pg 363]</span>
argumentativ resolv against giving religion any establishment
and protection.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" title="Virginia however iz not alone in this mezure. Rhode Island formerly took the same steps, and stil adheres to its liberality." class="fnanchor">[163]</a> </p>

<p>When men hav thrown off a restraint that iz disagreeable
and unreezonable, it iz to be expected that
they wil run into the extreme of licentiousness. Yet
it iz one of the most difficult problems in the history of
theze states, that the liberal and eminently lerned men,
who conduct the guvernment of Virginia, (and many
of their leeding karacters are of this description) should
not view the ministers of religion, in America, az destitute
of that odious and tremendous authority over human
consciences, which waz assumed under the papal
hierarky. I can hardly beleev a man of reeding and
reflection to be serious, when he asserts that legislatures
hav no right to compel the subject to <i>contribute to the
support of clergymen</i>, because they hav no authority <i>over
men's consciences</i>. Neether clergymen nor human laws
hav the leest authority over the conscience; nor iz any
such power implied in a law compelling every citizen
to contribute annually to the support of a clergyman.
But any sovereign authority may justly command the
citizens to establish and attend religious assemblies, az
wel az to meet for the choice of representativs, or send
their children to a skool; powers which were never
questioned. A man iz not bound in conscience to beleev
all the instructions of hiz preceptor; nor are the
citizens compellable to beleev the opinions and decisions
of a court of justice; but the legislature haz a
right to compel every citizen to pay hiz proportion of
taxes to maintain preceptors and judges. This iz precisely
the fact with respect to a legal support of clergymen.</p>

<p>No man iz bound in law or conscience to beleev all
a preecher says; but the whole question iz this; are
clergymen, az moral instructors, a beneficial order of
men? Haz their ministration a good effect upon society?
If this should be admitted, there iz no more dout
<span class="pb" id="Pg364">[pg 364]</span>
of the right of a legislature to support such men by
law, than there iz of their right of instituting universities
or courts of justice. That enormous error which
seems to be rivetted in popular opinion, <i>that the functions
of clergymen are of a spiritual and divine nature, and
that this order of men should hav no concern with secular
affairs</i>, haz laid the foundation of a separation of interest
and influence between the civil and ecclesiastical
orders; haz produced a rivalship az fatal to the peece of
society az war and pestilence, and a prejudice against <i>all
orders</i> of preechers, which bids fair to banish the "gospel
of peece" from some parts of our empire. The Kristian
religion, in its purity, iz the best institution on erth
for softening the ferocious tempers, and awakening the
benevolent affections of men. To this religion, Europe
and America are indetted for half their civilization.
There hav been periods, when mankind hav
suffered from ecclesiastical tyranny; but information
iz demolishing all systems of despotism, civil and ecclesiastical.
And when the clergy themselves leev all
rangling about speculativ points, which neether they
nor philosophers understand, and confine themselves
to publishing and enforcing the benevolent precepts of
a gospel which breethes nothing but universal luv and
peece to all mankind, they wil remoov the prejudices
against their order, they wil be <i>really</i> the messengers of
peece, they wil conciliate affection, and thus open the
harts of men to receev impressions of virtue, they wil
make men good citizens here, without which they are
never prepared to be members of a heavenly society;
and finally they wil establish a <i>rational moral influence</i>
over an enlightened peeple, equally fatal to the declamation
of ranting fanatics, and the pernicious amusement
of gambling at inns and horse-races.</p>

<p>In the Carolinas and Georgia, we find the state of
property, literature and religion, resembling that in
Virginia and Maryland. Charleston iz remarkable
for its hospitality and good order. But in the states
south of Pensylvania and Delaware, the divisions of
property, the habits of the peeple, and the dispersed
<span class="pb" id="Pg365">[pg 365]</span>
local situation of the planters, are all unfavorable to
improovments of any kind. Men who liv remote
from society, surrounded only by slaves, acquire manners
singular and often disagreeably imperious, ruf and
clownish. Urbanity iz acquired only in societies of
wel bred peeple. They cannot hav the benefit of
skools and churches, without which the body of a peeple
<i>cannot</i> be wel informed, and <i>wil</i> not acquire social
and virtuous habits. <ins class="err" title="The manners" id="E365">This manner</ins> of settlement
therefore, tho it may be necessary and beneficial to individuals,
may be considered az highly inauspicious in
a yung country, whoze constitutions of guvernment
are founded on the principle of equality, and cannot
flurish without mildness of manners and a general diffusion
of knowlege.</p>

<p>In the agricultural improovments of the united
states, there iz a remarkable difference, which must
hav proceeded principally from the slavery of the suthern.
In Virginia and Maryland, I should question
whether a tenth of the land iz yet cultivated. In New
England, more than half the whole iz cultivated, and
in Connecticut, scarcely a tenth remains in a wild state.
Yet Virginia haz been settled longer than New England.</p>

<p>I once heerd the <i>Prezident</i> remark, "that from the
northern to the suthern states, the agricultural improovments
are in an inverse proportion to the number of
slaves." This remark, like the actions of that illustrious
karacter, dezerves to be engraven on monuments
of marble. Slaves hav no motiv to labor; at leest,
none but what iz common to horses and cattle. They
want the only stimulus that unites industry with economy,
viz. the prospect of a permanent advantage from
their labor.</p>

<p>It haz been obzerved in Europe, that land rented on
long leeses, iz better cultivated, than that which iz
farmed on short leeses. A man who holds lands in
fee, will uze them to the best advantage, for he expects
hiz children wil enjoy the benefit. A man who haz
lands on very long leeses, haz neerly the same motivs
<span class="pb" id="Pg366">[pg 366]</span>
to improov them. Tenants for life wil make the most
of lands for themselves; but wil probably leev them
in the most impoverished condition. Lessees for a yeer
hav few motivs to keep a farm in good repair; and
slaves are the worst cultivaters on erth, az they hav the
leest interest in the fruits of their labor. One yeman,
who iz master of himself and hiz labors, and eets substantial
food, wil perform the work of four slaves.</p>

<p>This iz not the whole evil. Slaves not only produce
<i>less</i> than freemen, but they waste <i>more</i>; every
slave, az Dr. Franklin haz remarked in hiz Miscellaneous
wurks, being, from the nature of situation, a
<i>theef</i>. In addition to this, wherever slavery exists, a
great proportion of inhabitants are rendered indolent,
and indolence iz followed by vices and dissipation.</p>

<p>Suppoze twenty thousand men to do no productiv
business; what an immense difference wil this make
in the cultivation of a state and in the annual income.
In New England every man does some kind of business:
In the suthern states, the proprietors of large
plantations do little or no business. The reezon why
the planters make such a profit on the labor of their
slaves iz, that the subsistence of negroes iz not very expensiv.
The northern yemanry not only require more
clothing than the suthern, but they liv on expensiv food
and drinks. Every man, even the poorest, makes use
of tee, sugar, spirits, and a multitude of articles, which
are not consumed by the laborers of any other country.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" title="The consumption of beef in New England iz the reezon why the exports of that article do not exceed thoze of Ireland. Most of the laboring peeple in New England eet meet twice a day, and az much az their appetites demand. Suppose eech person to eet but six ounces a day on an average, which iz a low estimate, and the inhabitants of New England consume more than one hundred million pounds of meet, in a yeer...." class="fnanchor">[164]</a> </p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg367">[pg 367]</span>
But however cheep may be the subsistence of slaves,
while every thing iz left to a mercenary unprincipled
overseer and to lazy negroes, a state wil never be wel
cultivated. In autumn, 1785, a gentleman in Richmond
informed me he had just carried some manure
upon a field <i>to make an experiment for the first time</i>.
This fact wil hardly be beleeved in the northern states.
In travelling thro Virginia, from Alexandria to Williamsburg,
and also to Petersburg, I saw not one mill dam,
except what consisted of mere sand, thrown across
a streem. The idea of constructing dams of timber
and planks, laid so az to make an angle of forty five or
fifty degrees with the horizon, that it might gain
strength and stability in proportion to the pressure of
the incumbent water, seemed not, at that time, to hav
prevailed in Virginia. In a variety of particulars, the
slow progress of invention in the suthern states, waz
equally remarkable.</p>

<p>Slavery iz an evil of the worst kind; this iz generally
acknowledged. But what remedy can be applied?
To liberate the slaves at once would be madness; it
would ruin both masters and slaves. To liberate them
gradually, and suffer the freed men to liv with the
whites, might giv rise to discord and tumults. Colonization,
by a gradual exportation, iz an expedient that
would be safe and effectual, but cannot be put in execution.
The probability iz, that, in the lapse of time,
the blacks wil all be blended with the whites; the
mixed race wil acquire freedom, and be the predominant
<span class="pb" id="Pg368">[pg 368]</span>
part of the inhabitants. This event haz taken
place in Spanish America, between the nativs and
Spaniards; and, to a great degree, in some of the West
India islands. The same event iz rapidly taking place
in the suthern states. A propozition waz once made
in the house of delegates, in Virginia, for granting the
rights of freemen to the free blacks; it waz not carried;
but I do not see how any state can deny theze
rights to blacks that hav the legal qualifications of
property and residence. This privilege once granted,
would facilitate the intercourse between the whites and
blacks, and hasten the abolition of slavery.</p>

<p>In the climate of the united states, there are several
particulars that dezerv notice. In the first place, every
circumstance in the local position of Atlantic America,
concurs to render the wether variable. Theze states
extend thro fifteen degrees of latitude, in the temperate
zone; consequently must always experience the
extremes of winter and summer. Every part of this
territory experiences sudden changes of wether; but
the most numerous and violent changes, are between
the 36th and 43d degrees of latitude, on the Atlantic
coast. Within this district, the most frequent variations
seem to be in Pensylvania and Maryland. Four
months in the winter season, the wether in Pensylvania,
Maryland and Virginia, resembles the March wether
in New England; almost every week exhibiting the
varieties of cold, heet, frost, snow and rain. For two
months in the spring, and one in autumn, New England
iz expozed to eesterly winds and rain; except in
theze months, the changes of wether, tho sometimes
sudden and violent, are not very frequent. The eesterly
winds, which uzually bring rain, ceese about the
20th of May.</p>

<p>The variations of wether in the united states, arizing
from the latitude of their situation, are multiplied by
their position on the ocean. Water in an ocean iz of
a very uniform temperature; whereas land iz eezily
heeted and cooled. This circumstance creates an incessant
contest between heet and cold, on an extensiv
<span class="pb" id="Pg369">[pg 369]</span>
see coast; and of course an everlasting variableness of
winds. This iz true in all countries. According to
this theory, Atlantic America must always hav a variable
climate.</p>

<p>The south eest winds from the ocean, falling upon
the continent at right angles with the shore, invariably
produce rain; the opposit, or north west winds, proceeding
from the high lands in the back country, invariably
produce cold cleer wether. North eest winds, running
parallel with the shore, produce storms of snow in winter,
and long cold storms of rain in spring and autum.
Our most violent gales blow from the north eest. A
south westerly wind sometimes brings rain, and when
it first blows in winter, iz chilly; but it soon moderates
cold wether, and in summer it iz the <i>gentle zepher</i> of
the poets.</p>

<p>In speeking of winds, it iz necessary to correct a vulgar
error. It iz commonly said, that north west winds
contract their coldness from the vast lakes in the north
west regions of the united states. This iz an unphilosophical
opinion, for water always moderates the temperature
of the air; and it iz a wel known fact that
the large lakes do not freeze at all; so that if we were
to feel the wind immediately after passing over them,
we should find it always temperate. The truth iz, our
westerly winds come from high mountains and high
regions of the atmosphere, which are always cool. The
top of the blu ridge, or first range of mountains in Virginia,
iz about four thousand feet abuv its base. The
top of the Allegany or middle ridge, which iz the height
of land between the Atlantic and the Missisippi, tho
not so far from its base, must be much higher in the
atmosphere. How far the base of the blu ridge iz abuv
the surface of the ocean, haz not been ascertained; but
suppoze it five thousand feet, and the top of the Allegany,
two thousand feet abuv the blu ridge, and the
greatest elevation of land iz eleven thousand feet abuv
the waters of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The air on the tops of theze mountains iz never
heeted to the degree it iz in the low countries. The
cold regions of the atmosphere are much neerer to such
<span class="pb" id="Pg370">[pg 370]</span>
hights, than to a vast extended plain. Thus the tops
of mountains are often cuvered with snow, when the
land at the feet of them, iz fit for plowing. From the
regions of air abuv theze mountains, proceed the serene
cold winds which sweep the Atlantic states, purifying
the atmosphere and bracing the bodies of animals.</p>

<p>I would just remark here, that the climate of the
trans-alleganean country, wil never be expozed to the
frequent changes of air and violent tempests which
harrass the inhabitants of the Atlantic shore. The
force and disagreeable effects of eesterly winds from the
ocean, are broken by the mountains; and the northerly
winds wil be tempered by passing over the lakes;
while the sutherly winds wil be az refreshing in summer
az on this eestern coast. Theze remarks are now
verified by facts; altho by being cleered from forests,
the country wil become more expozed to variations of
wind.</p>

<p>In the second place, it iz obzervable that the climate
of America grows more variable, in proportion to the
cultivation of the land. Every person obzerves this
effect of cleering the lands in the eestern and middle
states. The heet in summer, and the cold in winter,
are not so steddy az formerly, being interrupted by
cool rains in summer, and moderate wether in winter.
Our springs and autums are longer, the former extending
into summer, and the latter into winter. The
cause of this change iz obvious: By levelling the forests,
we lay open the erth to the sun, and it becumes
more impressible with heet and cold. This circumstance
must multiply changes of wether. The cultivation
necessary to produce this effect, haz proceeded
about one hundred miles from the Atlantic, or perhaps
a little farther. But in Vermont and other back settlements,
the wether iz yet steddy; there being few
violent storms, especially in winter. The snow falls
gently, and lies til spring; whereas neer the Atlantic,
moderate wether for three or four days, or a warm rain,
often sweeps away the snow in January or February.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg371">[pg 371]</span>
But altho the wether iz growing more variable from
the cleering of lands, yet the salutary effects of cultivation
are vizible in the increesing salubrity of the climate.
The agu and fever iz a disorder that infests
most new settlements. Cultivation wil totally remoov
the causes of this disorder, from every tract of country,
which iz capable of being drained. Forty yeers ago,
this diseese prevailed in the state of Connecticut, in the
same manner it now does in Maryland. But for
twenty or thirty yeers past, it haz hardly been heerd of
in the state. There are a few places expozed to the effluvia
of marshy grounds, where the disorder stil infests
the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Some parts of the suthern states can never be drained;
the land iz so low that the freshes in the rivers, or
the tides, are almost constantly cuvering it with water.
Vegetable putrefaction may be considered az furnishing
the miasmata in any country; and the greatest
quantities of putrid effluvia are exhaled from lands
constantly expozed to a flux and reflux of water.</p>

<p>But all countries, except the very mountanous, when
first cleered, are infested with intermittants. Peeple on
the fronteers of New York and Vermont, are trubbled
with it, especially in low flat tracts of land. The
surface of a wilderness iz cuvered with leevs and rotten
wood; at the same time, it iz moist, the rays of the
sun being excluded by the trees. Therefore when
peeple first settle in a wilderness, they are not immediately
attacked with intermittents. They must lay open
the surface of the erth to the action of heet and wind;
the noxious effluvia then begin to rize, and wil infect
the air, til the whole surface of the erth iz dry and
sweetened by the heet of the sun. The amazing difference
in the state of a cultivated and uncultivated
surface of erth, iz demonstrated by the number of
small streems of water, which are dried up by cleering
away forests. The quantity of water, falling upon the
surface, may be the same; but when land iz cuvered
with trees and leevs, it retains the water; when it iz
cleered, the water runs off suddenly into the large
<span class="pb" id="Pg372">[pg 372]</span>
streems. It iz for this reezon that freshes in rivers
hav becume larger, more frequent, sudden and destructiv,
than they were formerly. This fact should be attended
to by the settlers in a new country, that they
may gard against sudden and extraordinary freshes in
the erection of mills and bridges.</p>

<p>It iz vulgarly suppozed that the wether in summer
iz hotter in the suthern states than in the northern.
This opinion iz not accurate. The truth iz, at particular
times, the northern states experience a greater
degree of heet than iz ever known in the suthern. In
the summer munths, the mercury in Farenheit often
rizes, in the middle of the day, much higher at Boston,
than at Charleston, in South Carolina. Thus in July,
1789, the mercury roze to 90Â° or upwards no less than
six days, and once to 93Â°, in the vicinity of Boston;
whereas at Charleston, it roze but once to 88Â° during
the same munth, and but four days to 87Â°. Besides
the meteorological obzervations I hav, were made at
Boston, at <i>one</i> o'clock, P. M. and in Charleston, at <i>two</i>
o'clock, when the heet iz usually the greatest. In August,
the same yeer, the mercury roze at Boston<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" title="I say Boston, but I beleev the observations to be made at Cambridge." class="fnanchor">[165]</a> four
days to 90, and once to 95Â°; but in Charleston, it roze
but once to 89Â°. The remark then ought not to be,
that the heet at the suthward iz <i>greater</i>; but that it
<i>continus longer</i>; that iz, the aggregate quantity of heet
in the suthern latitudes, exceeds that in the northern.
I hav taken some pains to ascertain the difference, and
omitting decimals, here giv the result of my enquiries.</p>

<p>The meen degree of heet for the whole munth of
July, 1789, in Charleston, South Carolina, by Farenheit's

<p>Theze facts, tho they cannot be the foundation of
exact calculations, because the observations were not
made at the same hour of the day, and perhaps the
thermometers were not exactly alike or in the same situation
az to heet, the facts I say may stil establish the
following conclusion:</p>

<p>That tho the middle of the days in summer may be
az warm and even warmer in New England, than in
Carolina, yet the nights are much cooler.</p>

<p>In July, the meen temperature at Boston, at seven
o'clock in the morning, waz seven degrees less than at
Charleston at six o'clock. At one o'clock, P. M. the
meen heet at Boston waz within three degrees of the
heet in Charleston at two o'clock. At ten o'clock at
night, the meen heet at Charleston, waz ten degrees
abuv that at Boston at nine o'clock. The meen temperature
for the whole month in Charleston, exceeded
that in Boston, seven degrees. Similar remarks may
be made of the munth of August.</p>

<p>Meen heet at Philadelphia, for January, 1789, 30Â°.</p>

<p>Here we may remark, that altho the meen heet of
New England, in the summer munths, approaches
within seven, eight, or nine degrees of that in Charleston,
yet in winter, it iz less than <i>half</i> the heet at
Charleston; the meen degree in Boston being twenty
five, and in Charleston, fifty two.</p>

<p>The meen temperature in Charleston, for March,
1789, waz about sixty one; and in Boston, for the
same munth, a little less than thirty five, which iz more
than half. In Pensylvania, the same munth, the meen
waz forty.</p>

<p>So far az I am able to calculate on obzervations in
my possession, I find the aggregate quantity of heet in
South Carolina, for a whole yeer, iz to that in New
England, az twenty to eleven; yet there are several
days almost every yeer, when the mercury in New
England rizes higher at noon than it ever does in
Carolina at any time. This may be ascribed to the
superior length of the days in the northern latitudes.</p>

<p>The heet of the suthern latitude iz suppozed to produce
fevers and other fatal disorders which prevail in
the Carolinas and Georgia. But heet iz not very often
pernicious, unless when operating upon a low, wet,
marshy surface of earth. All hilly countries are helthy;
and the air of the mountanous parts of Carolina, two
or three hundred miles from the see, iz in general salubrious.
But the marsh-effluvia iz not the only cause
of diseese; bad water iz a cause that should be mentioned,
and this abounds in a flat country; whereas
the water on hills and mountains iz generally pure.
In a great number of towns to the suthward of the
Delaware, and in some to the northward, the want of
good water iz a capital inconvenience.</p>

<p>On the whole, the climate of America iz az salubrious,
az that of any country in the same state of cultivation.
<span class="pb" id="Pg375">[pg 375]</span>
The European naturalists, with more spleen
than knowlege, hav condemned the climate of America,
az unfavorable to animal growth and perfection;
but if their ideas are founded on facts, the facts must be
taken from the naborhood of an Indigo plantation.
America, like all new countries, haz been expozed to
certain annual epidemic disorders; but wherever the
surface of the erth haz been, for a few yeers, cultivated,
theze disorders hav ceesed to rage. I am confident
that Connecticut, the most cultivated state in the union,
iz now az helthy az the south of France. I am confident
that the inhabitants enjoy az general helth, and
liv az long. Az to size, no part of the world can boast
of larger and more robust men than the northern
states. If I mistake not, the English estimate the meen
hight of their men to be <i>five feet, seven inches</i>; but I
am confident the average hight of the men in New
England, iz not less than <i>five feet nine, or ten inches</i>.</p>

<p>I could wish to ascertain the difference in the weight
of the atmosphere at Boston and Charleston; but hav
no obzervations on the barometer from the latter
place. The difference between the weight at Boston
and Philadelphia, upon an average of thirty days, appeers
to be very trifling, altho at any given day or
hour, it may be considerable.</p>

<p>There are some curious facts respecting the coast
of North America, which dezerve notis.</p>

<p>The Missisippi iz a river of great length, running
from the high northern latitudes, in neerly a south direction.
It iz deep and rapid. It resembles the Nile
in Africa, particularly in making land where it iz discharged
into the ocean. By the most accurate obzervations
of Mr. Huchins and others, the distance from
the Balize to New Orleans, iz something more than
two hundred miles, the whole of which iz land formed
by the discharge of the river. The Nile, in the time
of Herodotus, had formed considerable <ins class="err" title="ilans" id="E375">ilands</ins>, which
were then inhabited. Theze <ins class="err" title="ilans" id="E375a">ilands</ins> stil exist, between
the several channels by which that river iz discharged.
It iz probable, that by an accurate calculation of the
<span class="pb" id="Pg376">[pg 376]</span>
desent of the waters of the Missisippi, in certain places,
taking into account the most rapid and most moderate
flow, and ascertaining the distance of the mouth from
the most northerly sources, we might find, to a tolerable
degree of accuracy, the elevation of the land at the
sources of that river, abuv the level of the ocean.</p>

<p>Perhaps it wil be found that the mountains and
lands at the north west, are much higher in America
than in the north of Europe. Iz not this probable
from the hight of the Allegany, and the rapidity of
the river Missisippi? And would not the fact, if prooved,
in conjunction with other causes, which are wel
known, fully account for the superior degree of cold in
America under the same parallels? It iz wel known
that there are no considerable mountains to the north eest
of Great <ins class="corr" title="Brirain" id="C376">Britain</ins>, thro Denmark, Sweden and Russia.</p>

<p>On the Atlantic shore of America, the Gulf Streem
iz a curious phenomenon. It iz however wel accounted
for, on the suppozition that the trade winds drive
the waters of the ocean westward into the spacious
gulf of Mexico, where meeting the continent, they are
forced between the Bahama ilans and the coast of
Florida, and take their direction along the shore of the
united states. Such an immense body of waters, flowing
at the rate of three miles an hour, must produce
innumerable currents neer the shore; for every point
of land wil occasion an eddy, which wil be in proportion
to the extent of the point or cape from main coast.
Hence the variety of currents, in all directions, between
the streem and the American coast, which are
obzerved by our seemen.</p>

<p>Theze currents and eddies, at the same time <i>produce</i>
and <i>add to</i>, the points of land shooting into the ocean.
The cape of Florida iz probably produced between a
vast eddy of waters in the Mexican gulf, and the streem
which flows between the shore and Bahamas. For
theory indicates that the principal body of water, carried
along the Spanish main, or between that and the
West India ilans, must be forced to bend its course on
the Mexican shore, and by the coast of West Florida,
be thrown into a circular motion, so az to form a vast
<span class="pb" id="Pg377">[pg 377]</span>
eddy to the suthward and westward of <ins class="corr" title="Eeest" id="C377">Eest</ins> Florida.
Where this iz met by the streem, a point of land must
necessarily be formed.</p>

<p>It iz not improbable that Cape <ins class="err" title="Koman" id="E377">Roman</ins>, Cape Fear,
Cape Hatteras, and Cape Cod, may be formed by similar
currents, within the main Gulf Streem. A considerable
extent of land on the coast of Carolina and
Georgia, appeers to be made by the washing down of
sand from the high country, and the washing up of
sand by the Atlantic, whoze surges almost incessantly
beet the shore. But this alone wil not account for the
extension of points of sand, ten, fifteen or twenty leegs
into the ocean.</p>

<p>It iz a fact that capes and promontories are more frequently
harrassed with tempests, lightning and thunder,
than other parts of the shore or continent. This haz
been remarked of New York and Cape Hatteras. Can
a philosophical reezon be assigned for this phenomenon?
Perhaps there may be some attractiv power in land
thus situated; and perhaps tempests are generated by
the agitation of the air, produced by a flux and reflux
of water, or a variety of opposit currents. A storm
hangs over Cape Hatteras, every day, for a considerable
part of the yeer. I hav been witness to the fact,
for a number of days in succession. This circumstance
increeses the terror of navigating that coast; otherwize
so formidable to seemen for shoals and breakers.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" title="I once passed the cape at five or six leegs from the breakers, and found but seven fathoms of water." class="fnanchor">[166]</a> </p>

<p>In examining the harbors of North America, we
find most of them prezent a channel or entrance neerly
at right angles with the shore. The entrance into
most of them iz between the points of west and north.
The entrance into Newport, iz the safest in America,
and this iz almost the only harbor in the united states
which can be made with a northwesterly wind. This
circumstance iz highly favorable to ships coming upon
the coast in winter. This harbor iz capacious enough
to admit all the navees in Europe, and, if defensible,
may be the proper Portsmouth of America.</p>

<h2><span class="pb" id="Pg378">[pg 378]</span>No. XXVIII.</h2>

<p><small><i>The following iz part of an "Essay on the Dets of the
United States," written in 1787, but never before published.
The question haz been ably discussed in Congress,
and the proposition for a discrimination between original
and purchasing holders of certificates, which I had started,
without the prospect of support, haz been maintained
by very powerful arguments in our federal legislature.
Az the question now appeers to my mind, I should vote
against the proposition, yet merely on the ground that from
the manner in which the certificates were issued, it iz
impossible to discriminate, without multiplying the instances
of hardship and injustice. But I hav no more dout, that
legislatures hav a right to interfere, in certain extreme
cases, and suspend or counteract the operation of legal principles,
than I hav of any reveeled truth or intuitiv
proposition; and were it possible to ascertain the original
holders of certificates, I conceev our legislators could not
hav neglected a provision for their losses, without violating
their oaths, the constitution and public faith. The
following extract iz published, because I am desirous my
opinion on this subject should be known and recorded.</i></small></p>

<p><small>HARTFORD, MARCH, 1790.</small></p>

<p class="center"><big><i>On a</i> DISCRIMINATION <i>between the</i> ORIGINAL
HOLDERS <i>and the</i> PURCHASERS
<i>of the</i> CERTIFICATES <i>of the</i>
UNITED STATES.</big></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Objection 1.</span> It iz said that <i>public faith</i> requires
the payment of the certificates, according
to contract; that iz, to the bearers. Let me
ask the men who contend for promise, what they meen
by <i>public faith</i>? Did the public ever promise to do
rong? The money waz du to men who erned it; the
money waz not paid. The full valu expressed on the
<span class="pb" id="Pg379">[pg 379]</span>
certificates waz du, and the certificates were worth but
a fourth, or perhaps an eighth part of that valu. The
public promised the creditors their full demands; but
theze promises, at the time of issuing the certificates,
were actually worth but a small part of that demand.
Ought the creditors to be dismissed with this part of
their money, and then compelled to pay the full valu
of the certificates to their nabors, who purchased them
at their current price? If this iz right, my ideas of
justice are <i>rong</i>. Public faith iz suppozed to be founded
on justice. The public engaged to do justice to its
creditors; but this justice <i>haz</i> not been done; and it
appeers to me az plain az the shining of the sun, that
if the certificates should be paid to the bearers, justice
<i>wil</i> not be done. The creditors at the time of contract,
expected to receev gold and silver, or something
equivalent; they hav receeved neether the one nor the
other. They receeved articles which were worth but
a fourth part of their demands; for the remainder of
their money, the public iz stil their detor. Public
faith therefore requires, that the full valu of the alienated
certificates should not be paid to the bearer. It
appeers to me that the principles of equity, rather than
of law, should decide this important question. It iz
the design of the contract, not the words, which should
be pursued; for it must be remembered, that the design
of the public haz been counteracted. The intention
of the public, expressed on the certificates, haz
been defeated by the public exigences; and to pursue
the words of the engagement, wil now produce an effect
which waz not designed, viz. <i>extensiv injustice</i>.</p>

<p>In this situation the public haz an undouted right to
call in the evidences of the det, and form a system that
shall be effectual in the distribution of justice. If the
public suppoze that any arrangement for this purpoze
can be made, they certainly hav a right to attempt it;
for the object of the attempt would be public justice.
The sticklers for paying the det to the present holders,
hav the same object in view, <i>national faith</i>; but their
ideas of this faith, seem to be derived from the practice
<span class="pb" id="Pg380">[pg 380]</span>
of other nations, the situation of whoze dets bears very
little analogy to that of ours. They therefore advance
an argument against their own cauze; for the faith of
the public iz prezerved by fulfilling <i>the intention</i>, rather
than the <i>words</i>, of the contract.</p>

<p>Every dollar of old continental currency, promises a
Spanish milled dollar. This promise waz founded on
the supposition that the valu would be neerly the same,
or waz designed to prezerve the valu. But the depreciation
of that currency, by the enormous sums in circulation,
rendered the fulfilment of the promise impracticable;
and had it been attempted, it would hav
thrown the united states into confusion. The redemption
of the bills, at their nominal valu, would hav done
justice to a few, whoze money had depreciated in their
hands, but would hav ruined fifty times the number.
Thoze who lost their property by continental bills,
ought to be indemnified, if the persons and sums lost
could be ascertained; but this iz impossible. The case
of the certificates iz different. Theze are promissory
notes, expressing the sums du, and the persons names to
whom they were given. If in some instances the purchasers
hav returned alienated certificates to the office,
and taken out new ones in their own names, stil the
public books may remedy this inconvenience.</p>

<p>2. But it iz said the creditors of the public parted
with their certificates voluntarily. It waz at their own
option, whether to keep them or not; and if they choze
to alienate them at a discount, the public iz not responsible
for the loss. <i>A</i> owes <i>B</i> 100l. he cannot make
immediate payment, but haz property to secure <i>B</i>,
who takes a promissory note. <i>B</i> wants the money, and
rather than wait for <i>A</i>'s ability to pay it, he assigns the
note to <i>C</i> for 50l. In this case, <i>A</i> cannot refuse to
pay the full sum of 100l. because <i>C</i> gave but fifty for
the note. This reezoning iz applied to the case of the
public det; and yet a skool boy ought to be ashamed
of the application. The case iz not parrallel, and the
reezoning iz defectiv and inapplicable in every particular.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg381">[pg 381]</span>
In the first case, it iz not tru that the alienation of
the certificates waz a voluntary act; but in most cases,
waz an act of necessity. Most of the original creditors
were ether <i>rich</i> men who loaned money, or poor men
who did personal service. In many instances, thoze who
loaned money, loaned all their estates; and when they
found no provizion made for paying the interest, or
when the interest waz paid in paper of less valu than
specie, they were left destitute of the meens of subsistence.
Some of theze hav been obliged to part with
their certificates at a great loss. But a large number
of creditors were poor peeple, who had little or no
property, but their certificates, who had performed service,
and were under a necessity of negociating them on
az good terms az they could. Most of the alienations
hav therefore been a necessary consequence of public
delinquency. Many of the creditors hav experienced
a degree of distress, which, in a court of chancery,
would entitle them to a consideration and redress.
When a number of losses iz so great az to effect the
public, the legislature then becumes a court of equity,
where the sufferers must seek reparation. The legal
principle must be suspended, and special provision made
for this particular case. Thoze creditors who were
able to keep their certificates, hav generally done it, and
on every principle are entitled to the full nominal valu.</p>

<p>In the second place, the case of an individual assignee
of a bond wil not apply; for <i>B</i>, in the suppozition,
takes the bond voluntarily. <i>A</i>, the dettor, haz property,
and it iz optional with <i>B</i>, whether to bring a suit
for the money, recover a judgement, and take <i>A's</i>
property, or take a bond on interest. This iz generally
the case with individuals, but not with the public
creditors. Theze hav no alternativ; they must take
promises, which the subject cannot compel the public
to fulfil, when the money iz wanted. In another particular,
the two cases are widely different. <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and
<i>C</i>, are three distinct persons. <i>A</i> iz the dettor, and it iz
indifferent whether he pays the det to <i>B</i> or <i>C</i>. But
when <i>B</i> haz sold the note for half the valu, he cannot
<span class="pb" id="Pg382">[pg 382]</span>
be called upon for the money, nor for any part of it.
In the other case, the creditors and the public are, in
some mezure, the same person. The same persons
who looze their property by public delinquency, are afterwards
taxed to pay their proportion to the purchasers.
But I wil for a moment suppoze the two cases
exactly similar; for I am willing to giv my antagonists
the fairest field of argument; and what conclusion can
be drawn in favor of paying the certificates to the bearers?
Can that reezoning be just which draws general
consequences from particular propozitions? Such bad
logic ought not to impeech a man's heart; but it can
do very little honor to hiz head.</p>

<p>Do men, who reezon in this manner, consider that
a principle with respect to individuals, may be perfectly
<i>just</i>, and yet pursued to a certain degree, it may become
entirely false? That the same principle which
may be good in a certain degree, may, in the extreme
becume criminal, iz tru not only in politics, but in the
natural and moral systems. Heet and water, prouduce
vegetables; but too large portions of either, destroy
plants. Every passion, natural to man, iz good in itself,
and the wurk of a perfectly wise being; but any
passion indulged to a certain degree, becumes criminal
and destructiv to social happiness. Self-love, the spring
of all action, and in the tru sense of the word, the
most necessary principle in creation, when it becumes
excessiv, iz az criminal and pernicious, az the most
malignant passion. Eeting and sleeping are essential to
helth; but beyond a certain degree, they are hurtful,
and may be fatal to the human body.</p>

<p>In politices, the greatest possible good iz the end of
guvernment. Any principle, which may be tru, in
particular instances, but which, when extended to the
public, does not produce the greatest good to society, iz
certainly false in legislation. A law which may be
good and <ins class="err" title="necessarily" id="E382">necessary</ins> in a community, may stil bear
hard upon individuals. This iz generally tru of all
laws. If a man takes a note of another, and sells it for
half its valu, he haz no remedy in law, nor ought the
<span class="pb" id="Pg383">[pg 383]</span>
law to make provision for hiz case; for laws are, in
their nature and use, general; they do not desend to
particular cases. The reezon iz obvious. Were
laws to notice every inconvenience, which may flow
from their operation, they would produce confusion
rather than order, and occasion greater injuries to
the public, than would result from the losses of individuals.
But when such particular losses becume general,
the principle loozes its force. Sufferings, multiplied
to a certain number, becume public, and then require
the interference of the legislature. If a man iz
in det, and cannot pay, he iz at the disposal of the law;
the law cannot be suspended nor relaxed for hiz particular
benefit. But when the body of a peeple becume
involved, the public safety requires a suspension or relaxation
of law. If an individual settles upon land of
another man, he iz considered az a trespasser, and iz
liable to an ejectment. But let thirty thousand men
settle thus upon land that iz not their own, and a wize
legislature wil confirm them in their possessions. Necessity
or general good, in such cases, suspends the operation
of legal right, or rather changes <i>private rongs</i>
into <i>public right</i>. Or to express the idea differently;
when evils are increesed and extended to a certain degree,
it iz better to let them remain, than to risk the
application of a violent remedy. Instances of this
kind occur so frequently, that it iz needless to multiply
examples. Nothing betrays greater weekness, than
the reezoning of peeple, who say, if a principle iz just,
it extends to all cases. I should however be very unhappy
to hav such men for my legislators. It may be
asked, where iz the line of distinction? I answer, it
may be impossible to determin. Where the <i>right</i> ends,
and the <i>rong</i> begins; where the legal principle should
ceese to operate, and special legislativ interference becumes
necessary, it may be difficult to discuver; but
the extreme iz always obvious. Whenever the operation
of a receeved maxim or principle givs general uneasiness,
it iz a demonstrativ proof that it iz rong:
that it produces public evil; and a wize legislator wil
<span class="pb" id="Pg384">[pg 384]</span>
restrain the operation, or establish a different principle:
On the suppozition therefore that the present holders of
the public det, are precisely in the situation of the assignees
of bonds, stil the principle wil not apply nor
warrant the same conclusion in both cases; becauze
we cannot reezon from particulars to generals, especially
on political subjects.</p>

<p>Suppoze the original creditors to be five, and the
present holders two; more than half the number of
creditors hav lost the money which waz due to them;
the loss affects them in the first instance, and the hevy
taxes which are necessary to appreciate the certificates
in other hands, double their injuries and complaints.
Theze loozing creditors hav an idea that they are really
cheeted, and their murmurs foment that popular
jealousy which iz ever bizzy to check large and sudden
revolutions of property. The certificates fall into the
hands of rich men, at a great discount, and the body
of the peeple say, "we wil not suffer our own losses to
enrich our welthy nabors."</p>

<p>This outcry, it iz said, proceeds from a levelling
principle, which aims to destroy all distinction of rank
and property. But in the present case, the popular
complaints proceed from equitable principles; nor do
I know of any instance of public jelousy, excited by an
acquizition of property in the course of honest industry.
Fortunes may be suddenly raized in private business,
by commercial speculations, and no notice taken of the
event; but when public delinquency haz thrown numberless
advantages into the hands of a particular class
of men, which the peeple know are made at their own
expense, it iz impossible that they should behold such a
change of property, without questioning the propriety
of it, and the justness of the principle by which it iz
defended. When the common sense of mankind iz
oppozed to such a change, it ought to be considered az
a good proof that it iz not just.</p>

<p>Whatever conclusions therefore may be drawn from
a principle, established in <i>courts</i> of <i>law</i>, or among nations
in different circumstances, the public sense of
<span class="pb" id="Pg385">[pg 385]</span>
justice must, after all, decide the question. A lawyer
may wurk himself up to convictions, in wire-drawing
principles; but hiz reezoning iz oppozed to the sense
of mankind. Peeple may not be able to <i>discuver</i> the
fallacy of the reezoning, but they can <i>feel</i> it. They
may be <i>silenced</i>, but cannot be <i>convinced</i>.</p>

<p>One grain of common sense iz worth a thousand
cobweb theories; and however peeple may be abuzed
for refining upon justice, we rarely find them generally
dispozed to do rong.</p>

<p>The domestic det of America furnishes a new era in
the history of finance. We hav no examples to follow;
we must pursu some practicable system, with our
eyes invariably fixed on public justice. I know it iz
said that the original creditors can purchase certificates
now, at the same or a less price than they took for
them. But this iz not strictly tru. Individuals might
purchase at a low rate; but a general demand for them
would raize their valu much abuv their current valu at
any past period: For it should be considered that hitherto
the sellers hav been numerous, and the purchasers,
few; that iz, a full market, with little demand
for the articles. Reverse the case. Let the sellers becume
the purchasers; the demand would at once raize
the valu of the certificates neerly to the face of them.</p>

<p>But if the certificates were to pass at their present
low valu, few of thoze who hav alienated them, could
re-purchase; for the same necessity which obliged them
to sell at a loss, now prevents their repurchasing. Peeple
hav not grown rich since the revolution; especially
thoze who were faithful in the service of their country.
At any rate it iz to be wished that the certificates
might ceese to circulate az objects of speculation.
They are a Pandora's box to this country.</p>

<p>Almost the whole activ specie of the country iz employed
in speculation. Laws prohibiting usury, restrain
the loan of money, while the certain profits of
speculation amount to five or ten times the legal interest.
No money can be borrowed; no capitals can
<span class="pb" id="Pg386">[pg 386]</span>
be raized to encurage agriculture and manufactures:
Lucrativ industry iz checked; land iz sunk to two
thirds of its real valu, and multitudes of industrious
peeple are embarrassed. From such evils, good Lord
deliver us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="ralign"><small>HARTFORD, JANUARY, 1790.</small></span></p>
<p class="center"><big><i>An</i> ADDRESS <i>to</i> YUNG GENTLEMEN.</big></p>

<p>At a time of life when the passions are lively and
strong, when the reezoning powers scarcely begin
to be exercised, and the judgement iz not yet ripened
by experience and obzervation, it iz of infinit consequence
that yung persons should avail themselves of
the advice of their frends. It iz tru that the maxims
of old age are sometimes too rigorous to be relished by
the yung; but in general they are to be valued az the
lessons of infallible experience, and ought to be the
guides of youth. The opinions here offered to your
consideration hav not the advantage of great age to giv
them weight, nor do they claim the authority of long
experience: But they are formed from <i>some</i> experience,
with much reeding and reflection; and so far az a
zeel for your welfare and respectability in future life
merits your regard, so far this address haz a claim to
your notis.</p>

<p>The first thing recommended to your attention iz,
the care of your helth and the prezervation of your
bodily constitution. In no particular iz the neglect of
parents and guardians more obvious and fatal, than in
suffering the bodies of their children to grow without
care. My remark applies in particular to thoze who
design their children to get a living without manual labor.
Let yung persons then attend to facts, which are
always before their eyes.</p>

<p>Nature seldom fails to giv both sexes the materials
of a good constitution; that iz, a body complete in all
its parts. But it depends mostly on persons themselves
to manage theze materials, so az to giv them strength
and solidity.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg388">[pg 388]</span>
The most criticcal period of life, in this respect, iz
the age of puberty, which iz usually between thirteen
and seventeen, or eighteen. Before this period, you
are very much in the power of parents or masters, and
if they wish to see you strong and robust, they wil feed
you with coarse substantial food of eezy digestion. But
at fourteen yeers old, yung persons are capable of exercising
their reezon, in some degree, and ought to be instructed
in the mode of living, best calculated to secure
helth and long life. It iz obzervable that yung persons
of both sexes grow tall very rapidly about the age
of thirteen, fourteen, fifteen or sixteen; but they do
not acquire muscular strength in du proportion. It
should then be the bizziness of yung persons to assist
nature, and strengthen the growing frame by athletic
exercises.</p>

<p>Thoze persons who leed a sedentary life, should practis
some amusement which requires considerable exertion
of the lims; az running, foot ball, quoit; taking
care not to injure themselves by too violent exertion;
for this would defeet the salutary purpose of such exercizes.
But the exercize I would most recommend, iz
<i>fencing</i>; for the art itself iz highly useful at times, and
the practice tends more to render the body firm and
vigorous than almost any exercize whatever. It braces
the muscles of the arm, spreds the brest, opens the
chest to giv the lungs play; an effect of great consequence
to persons about the age of puberty. For, az
waz before obzerved, persons of this age, shoot up very
fast; the body grows tall, but narrow; the mass of
flesh and blood iz increesed much faster than the tone
of the vessels and muscular strength; the chest iz two
narrow for the lungs to perform their office, and the
blood vessels hav not sufficient elasticity to produce a
brisk free circulation; the system iz often too week to
carry on the necessary secretions of the juices; and the
consequence of the whole iz, an obstructed circulation
produces ulcers upon the lungs, which bring on a decay,
or some infirmities of body, which last for many
yeers, and not unfrequently for life.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg389">[pg 389]</span>
To avoid theze ills, much exercise of the arms and
body iz not only useful, but necessary; and when it iz
not the lot of yung persons to labor, in agriculture or
mekanic arts, some laborious amusement should be
constantly and daily pursued az a substitute, and none
iz preferable to fencing. A fencing skool iz perhaps
az necessary an institution in a college, az a professorship
of mathematics; for yung men usually enter college
about the age of puberty; and often leev a laborious
occupation, to commence a sedentary life, at the
very time when labor or other exercize iz the most
necessary to giv firmness and vigor to their constitutions.
In consequence of this change and an academic
life, they often run up into long, slender, effeminate
bodies, which a slight cold may throw into a consumption;
or by intense application to books, add, to a debilitated
frame of body, a week nervous system, which
keeps them always dying, tho it may not end life til
old age.</p>

<p>Dancing iz an excellent amusement for yung peeple,
especially for thoze of sedentary occupations. Its excellence
consists in exciting a cheerfulness of the mind,
highly essential to helth; in bracing the muscles of the
body, and in producing copious perspiration. Az the
two first effects are very visibly beneficial, they are the
subject of common obzervation; but the last, which
iz perhaps the most generally beneficial, iz rarely mentioned.</p>

<p>Experience haz led me to the following ideas on
this subject. Our bodies are so constituted that a large
portion of the juices should be thrown off by insensible
perspiration; nor can the process be abated without
danger, nor wholly obstructed without occasioning diseese.
The body must perspire, or must be out of order.
A violent cold iz a sudden obstruction of the
process, which throws the matter, intended for evacuation
thro the pores of the skin, back upon the <i>intestines</i>,
taking the word, not in a tecknical, but in its original
extended sense. All that iz necessary to cure a cold,
which iz not attended with symptoms of inflamation, iz
<span class="pb" id="Pg390">[pg 390]</span>
to open the pores of the body; which may be done by
bracing, az by drinking cold water, which excites circulation
by its tonic power; or by relaxing the system,
az by the warm bath and warm teas. The first wil
answer, where the body haz vigor enough to giv the
tonic its full effect; but iz not so efficacious, nor so
generally practicable az the last. It iz not so eezy to
force thro a wall, az to open a gate.</p>

<p>The common house-wifely remedies, consisting of
butter or other oily substances, mixed with spirits,
usually hav no effect upon a cold, or a bad one. Flannel,
warm teas, or simple warm water, hav the best effect
in relaxing; but if they fail of producing a perspiration,
the patient should hav recourse to exercise.
Dancing in a warm room, or other violent exercise,
wil generally throw a person into a copious swet in a
few minutes; and this, two or three times repeeted,
wil usually releev the person, however obstinate the
cold. If every thing else fails, the warm bath should
be resorted to az an almost infallible remedy.</p>

<p>But there iz another species of obstructed perspiration
more dangerous perhaps than sudden colds, because
less perceptible; I meen, that which proceeds
from a week habit of body. Whenever the tone of
the vessels iz lost, the circulation of the blood becumes
languid, the animal heet iz diminished, and the system
haz not strength sufficient to throw off the perspirable
matter. The consequence iz, the skin becumes dry
and rigid, and the person usually feels a dull pain in hiz
hed and the back part of hiz neck. Wimen, literary
men, clerks, &amp;c. are most expozed to theze symptoms.
The remedy for them iz, free perspiration; but the
most effectual remedy iz dancing, or other vigorous
exercise, which increeses, at the same time, animal
heet and the tone of the vessels. Dancing indeed
unites to theze, the other advantage of cheerfulness and
good spirits, which iz of singular use to persons accustomed
to close application to bizziness or contemplation.
The only caution to be obzerved iz, not to go into the
cold air, without considerable additional clothing.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg391">[pg 391]</span>
In cases where persons cannot hav recourse to dancing
or other exercize in a warm room, the warm bath
may be uzed to great advantage. At first thought, one
would imagin, that the cold bath should be prescribed
for giving tone to a week system; but on reflection,
this would appeer to be generally, tho not always hazardous.
The truth iz, a general relaxation of the body
checks perspiration; and the first effect of cold, in such
cases, iz to brace the exterior parts of the body, and
throw the offending matter, lodged in the skin by the
debility of the system, back upon the lungs, or other
interior parts. If the system haz strength enough, or
can receev enough by the operation of cold, to force
open the pores and produce a copious perspiration, the
cold bath wil hav an excellent effect. But when the
person iz of a week frame, the experiment iz extremely
dangerous. The safest remedy iz the warm bath, which
remooves the obstructing matter by a gentle relaxation
of the surface; thus enabling the vessels to recuver
their tone, in a degree, and keep up a brisk circulation.
The warm bath then iz the most safe and efficacious
remedy for obstructed perspiration, occasioned by debility;
and this iz an evil to which all sedentary peeple
are expozed, and by which most of them suffer.</p>

<p>I hav been often suprized that the moderns hav so
generally neglected the meens of prezerving helth,
which were uzed by the ancients. A little attention
to the structure of the human body, and the effect of
heet and cold upon it, led the ancients to the obvious
and almost infallable meens of garding themselves from
diseeze. Their method waz to bathe almost daily;
and then oil their bodies. By bathing, they kept their
perspiration free, and their bodies of course, in vigor and
clenly; and by the use of oil, they secured the body
from the fatal effects of sudden cold. In the later
ages of Rome, warm baths indeed became a luxury,
and were uzed to excess; but this waz only an abuse
of a good thing, the excellent effects of which had
been experienced for ages. The neglect of the same
meens, of preventing diseese, haz obliged the modern
<span class="pb" id="Pg392">[pg 392]</span>
to hav recourse to physic, a substitute, more expensiv
and trublesome, and not always effectual.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" title="It iz evident, from the silence of all ancient monuments, that the heeling art waz not cultivated, and scarcely known among the old Romans. For several ages from the bilding of Rome, there iz hardly any mention made of a physician. Pliny relates, that Rome flurished, six hundred yeers, without physicians; that iz, the profession waz not honorable, being confined to servants or other low karacters. In Seneca's time, many of theze had acquired estates by the bizziness;..." class="fnanchor">[167]</a> </p>

<p>Whether in bizziness or amusement, let your whole
conduct be guided by temperance. Are you students?
Eet moderately, and let your food be of the nutritiv
kind, but not oily, high seesoned and indigestible.
Drink but little, or rather no distilled liquors; wine
and fermented liquors are much to be preferred. A
good cup of tee, iz sometimes a cordial; coffee may
be uzed freely; but the constant use of hot liquors seldom
fails to debilitate the system and impair the digestiv
powers.</p>

<p>Whether you reed or rite, accustom yourselves to
stand at a high desk, rather than indulge an indolent
habit of sitting, which always weekens, and sometimes
disfigures the body. The neerer you can keep every
part of the body to an eezy strait posture, the more
equable wil be the circulation of the fluids; and in order
to giv them the most unconstrained flow to the extremities
of the lims, it iz very useful to loosen thoze
parts of dress that bind the lims closely.</p>

<p>There iz another kind of temperance which I would
warmly recommend; that iz, temperance in study.
Little does a helthy robust yuth reflect upon the delicate
texture of the nervous system, which iz immediately
affected by close mental application. The full
fed muscular man may spurn the caution, that warns
<span class="pb" id="Pg393">[pg 393]</span>
him against the danger of hypocondriacs; but it iz
next to impossible that the hard student, who clossets
himself seven or eight hours a day, in deep meditation,
should escape the deplorable evil, which makes men
valetudinarians for life, without hope of a radical cure,
and with the wretched consolation of being perpetually
laughed at.</p>

<p>Four hours of uninterrupted study in a day iz generally
sufficient to furnish the mind with az many ideas
az can be retained, methodized and applied to practice;
and it iz wel if one half of what are run over in this
time are not lost. It may sometimes be necessary to
study or reed <i>more</i> hours in a day; but it wil az often
be found useful to reed <i>less</i>.</p>

<p>When you exercize at any diversion, or go into
company, forget your studies, and giv up yourselves entirely
to the amusement. It wil do you no good to
leev your books behind, unless you dismiss your attention
or train of thinking. Attend to experience.
You find it very fateeging to stand, sit or even to lie
in one fixed posture, for any length of time, and change
affords releef. The same iz tru of the mind. It iz
necessary, if I may indulge the expression, to change the
pozition of the mind; that iz, vary the train of
thought; for by a variety of ideas, the mind iz releeved,
in the same degree az the body by a change of posture.</p>

<p>When you reed, always endevor to reed with some
particular object. You wil find many books that
ought to be red in course; but in general when you
take up a treetis upon any science, or a volum of history,
without a view to inform yourself of some <i>particular</i>
in that wurk, you are not likely to retain what
you reed. The object iz too general; the mind iz
not capable of embracing the whole. For instance, if
you reed Hume's England in course, with design to
acquaint yourself with the whole story, you wil find, at
the end of your labor, that you are able to recollect
only a few of the most remarkable occurrences; the
greatest part of the history haz escaped you. But if
<span class="pb" id="Pg394">[pg 394]</span>
you confine yourself to <i>one point of history</i> at a time, for
example, the life and policy of Alfred, or the account
of Mary, queen of Scots, and reed what every author
you can lay your hand on, haz said upon that subject,
comparing their different accounts of it, you wil impress
the history upon the mind, so az not to be eezily
effaced. Law students should attend to theze remarks.</p>

<p>There iz another kind of temperance of more consequence
than thoze mentioned, viz. temperance in
plezure: For to all the personal evils of an excessiv indulgence
of the animal appetite, we may add innumerable
evils of a moral and social nature. No intercourse
should take place between the sexes, til the body
haz attained to full strength and maturity. In this respect,
ancient barbarous nations hav set an example,
that ought to make moderns blush for their effeminacy
of manners, and their juvenile indulgences. The old
Germans accounted it shameful and disreputable for
yung men to hav any intercourse with the other sex,
before the age of twenty.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" title="Qui diutissime impuberes permanserunt, maximam inter suos ferunt laudem: HÃ´c ali staturam, ali vires, nervosque confirmari putant. Intra annum vero xx feminÃ¦ notitiam habuisse, in turpissimis habent rebus.---- Cesar De Bel. Gal. lib. 6. 19." class="fnanchor">[168]</a> To this continence were
they much indetted for their muscular bodies, their
helth and longevity. But such an abstinence from
plezure waz not maintained by law; the Germans
knew that positiv prohibitions would be ineffectual to
restrain this indulgence; they had recourse to the only
certain method; they made it <i>dishonorable</i>. How different
iz the case in modern times! So far iz debauchery
from being scandalous, that it iz frequently the
boast of men in the first offices of state; and a karacter
of licentiousness iz little or no objection in a candidate
for preferment.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" title="The ancients were wiser than the moderns in many respects; and particularly in restraining certain vices by opinion, rather than by positiv injunctions. Duelling and profane swearing are prohibited by the laws of most countries; yet penalties hav no effect in preventing the crimes, whilst they are not followed by loss of reputation. Vices which do not immediately affect the lives, honor or property of men, which are not mala in se, which are eezily conceeled, ..." class="fnanchor">[169]</a> </p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg395">[pg 395]</span>
Oppozed to passion and to false pride, caution wil
perhaps be unavailing. But men who wish for permanent
happiness, should be persuaded to take the
meens for securing it. Wil you then run the risk of
erly indulgence in illicit plezure? Some of you <i>may</i>
escape the evils which generally follow; but the chances
are against you. In nine cases of ten, you wil destroy
the vigor of your bodies, and thus impair the
ability of enjoyment by excess; or what iz an additional
evil, you wil contract diseese. What iz the consequence?
Eether your taste for the vilest plezures wil
grow into habit and make abandoned rakes of you,
averse to the innocent enjoyments of the married life,
and of course bad members of society; or you wil
perhaps marry amiable wimen, with your strength and
helth impaired, and your minds debauched, fickle,
prone to jelousy. In this case, you are neether secure
<span class="pb" id="Pg396">[pg 396]</span>
of your partners affections, nor wil you be likely to
know the valu of their virtues. Having broken over
the barriers of virtue, you are forever liable to stray;
and the probability iz, you destroy the happiness of
your wives, and the peece of your families. Perhaps
with some art, and the forgiving temper of your wives,
you may conceel the family discord, and the wretched
state of your minds, from a censorious world; pride,
reputation, every motiv would urge you to this precaution;
but iz not this a poor substitute for happiness?
A poor consolation for the multiplied evils that
follow, in an endless train, from the unreezonable and
criminal indulgences of a few yeers? You may be assured
also that a woman of good principles cannot feel
a pure satisfaction, in the company even of a reformed
husband, when she reflects, az she frequently wil, that
he haz wasted hiz helth and substance upon the vilest
of her sex. My yung frends, it iz idle, it iz weekness
and folly to expect any kind of happiness or plezure,
which shal indemnify you for the trubble of seeking it,
except in the pursuance of the principles which morality
prescribes. Whenever you pursu an object, at the
expense of any moral principle; when the attainment
of your end must injure the person, the property, the
reputation or the feelings of one child of Adam, the
acquisition of that object wil not giv you happiness;
you are pursuing a fantom. This leeds me to say
something on one of the most hanous crimes a man
can commit, and which the laws of society cannot or
at leest do not punish; that iz, seduction.</p>

<p>Fashion, which iz often founded on moral propriety,
and oftener on political convenience, iz sometimes an
enemy to both; and public opinion, enlisted in the
cauze of vice, iz a greater scurge to society than war
or pestilence. It iz one of the evils, or rather of the
curses of civilization, that certain crimes, az malignant
in their nature, and az fatal in their consequence, az
murder and robbery, becume fashionable, and to a certain
degree, reputable. Of this kind, iz deliberate seduction.
It iz az malignant in its nature az murder,
<span class="pb" id="Pg397">[pg 397]</span>
for it iz accompanied with the same aggravation, malice
<ins class="corr" title="prepense" id="C397">pretense</ins>, or a premeditated design: It iz az fatal to
society; for reputation iz az deer az life; and the
wretched victims of deception, if they lay violent hands
on themselves, or linger out a life of disgrace, are equally
murdered, equally lost to society. And the only
reezon why the seducer and the murderer hav not been
placed on a footing by the laws of society, must be, the
difficulty of proof, or of ascertaining the degrees of gilt,
where there iz a possibility or a presumtion of assent
on the part of the woman.</p>

<p>There are however certain instances of this crime
which are az capable of proof az, arson, burglary or
murder; and why the laws of a state, which prohibit
under severe penalties, the taking or giving more than
six per cent. interest on the loan of money, even on the
fairest contract, should yet permit the seducer to take
another's reputation, to doom to indelible infamy the
helpless female, whoze reputation iz all her portion, iz
one of thoze problems in society, which the philosopher
wil impute to human imperfection, and the Kristian
number among the inscrutable mysteries of providence.</p>

<p>But I am not addressing legislators; I am reezoning
with individuals. Waving the baseness of the crime,
let us attend to its consequences in families and society.
You wil doutless acknowlege, for I do not see
how you can deny, that when you deliberately commit
a crime that affects your nabor, you explicitly admit
that your nabor haz an equal right to commit the same
crime against yourselves; for I presume no man wil
arrogate to himself an exclusiv privilege of being a villan.</p>

<p>You attempt then to seduce the wife, the sister, or
the dawter of your frend; but hav you none of theze
relations? Hav you not a wife, a sister, a dawter, whoze
reputation iz deer to you; whoze honor you would
die to defend? You hav attacked the honor of your
nabor; haz he not the same right to assail your family,
in the same delicate point? But if you has none of
<span class="pb" id="Pg398">[pg 398]</span>
theze neer connections, hav you no female frend whoze
<ins class="corr" title="reputatation" id="C398">reputation</ins> iz deer to you? Now by attempting the
honor of any woman, you wage war with the whole
human race; you break down the barriers which nature
and society hav established to gard your <i>own</i> family
and frends, and leev <i>their</i> honor and happiness, and
consequently your <i>own</i>, expozed to the intreegs of every
unprincipled retch: You even invite an attempt
upon your family and frends; you beet a challenge,
and bid defiance to any man who haz the spirit to revenge
the rongs of the helpless. Theze are serious
considerations, in which men of principle and of no
principle are equally interested; for an abandoned rake
iz usually az fond of hiz own and hiz family's honor,
az the man of the chastest life.</p>

<p>Mingle with your superiors in age and wizdom,
whenever you can do it with propriety. If your parents
are wize, they wil associate with you az much az
possible in your amusements; they wil be cheerful and
facetious, and thus make you az happy az you wish to
be at home. A morose crabbed old man iz not inviting
company for the yung and sprightly; and you ought
rather to shun the illnatured, if possible. But whenever
your parents are of a cheerful dispozition, and luv
their children, they make the most agreeable and most
useful companions. They wil find amusements for
you at home, and you wil be happier there than any
where else. If your parents are thus dispozed to make
themselves your principal companions, always indulge
their inclination. You wil thus avoid the contagion
of vicious company, you wil form a habit of contentment
and satisfaction at home; and remember, if you
do not find happiness there, you wil never find much
satisfaction abroad.</p>

<p>In choosing society however, be careful not to push
yourself into company. Yung men are often impatient
of the restraints which modesty and decorum impoze
upon them. They are anxious to associate with
thoze of greater age and rank than themselves; and
expect more notis than mankind in general suppoze
<span class="pb" id="Pg399">[pg 399]</span>
they dezerv. This proceeds from the ambition and
fire of youth; the motivs I beleev to be often innocent
and laudable; the ambition therefore should be guverned,
rather than repressed. A little experience wil
dictate patience and a modest deportment, which, with
yeers and information, wil always ensure respectability.
I once knew a man of twenty two chagrined even to
petulence, becauze he could not be admitted a trustee
of a college. I waz surprized at hiz severe remarks
on the venerable body of gentlemen who rejected him.
He thought himself a man of more science than some
of the corporation; and therefore better qualified to
direct a literary institution. Admit the fact, that he
excelled in scientific attainments, yet the vexation he
felt at hiz disappointment waz proof enough that he
waz destitute of the first requisits in the overseers of
yuth, <i>coolness</i> and <i>judgement</i>.</p>

<p>In the world, avoid every species of affectation, and be
az fashionable az convenience wil warrant. Yet never
be the first to invent novelty, nor run to excess in imitation.
This advice, <i>to be fashionable</i>, should however be
qualified, and restrained to things indifferent, in point
of morality. Az the moral karacter of men does not
depend on the shape of their garments, it iz generally
best to wear our clothes in the model that fashion prescribes;
unless your circumstances forbid, or the fashion
itself iz inconvenient: For if you are not able to afford
the expense, it iz criminal in you to follow the
customs of the welthy; and if the shape of a garment
makes it uneezy upon you or cumbersome, the fashion
iz ridiculous, and none but week peeple, the common
coxcombs and butterflies of the world, wil adopt it.
For this reezon follow lord Chesterfield's maxims with
great caution. His letters contain a strange compound
of the <i>best</i> and <i>worst</i> instructions ever given to a yung
man; indeed it would be expected of a man, whoze
object waz not to make hiz son <i>good</i>, but to make him
<i>showy</i>.</p>

<p>Hiz lordship, I think, recommends to hiz son to wear
<i>long nails</i>; in consequence of which advice, long nails
<span class="pb" id="Pg400">[pg 400]</span>
are very fashionable wherever hiz letters are red. But
a man ought to be consistent. Why did he not at the
same time recommend long beards? Both are very
proper among savages, who hav no ideas of neetness;
and one would think, they should always go together;
but among civilized peeple, both are equally slovenly.
Hiz lordship givs an excellent reezon for hiz advice;
that mekanics pare their nails, and <i>gentlemen</i> ought to
be distinguished from <i>laborers</i>. Why did not he add,
that az mekanics walk on two feet, gentlemen, for sake
of distinction, ought to walk on all fours? But hiz
lordship had better reezons for hiz advice. Long nails
are a most commodious substitute, or at leest furnish a
reddy alleviation of the evils arizing from a sparing use
of ivory. Besides, hiz lordship waz a courtier, fond of
royal examples, &amp;c. He found a princely one in the
Assyrian monark, who, when he waz a beest, wore hiz
nails in the same manner. Nebuchadnezzer however
waz under the direction of a divine impulse; an authority
that hiz lordship could not claim for <i>all</i> hiz injunctions
and maxims.</p>

<p>Never let fashion blind you to convenience and congruity.
Do not introduce foreign customs, without
reezon, or by the halves. The French feed themselves
with forks, uzing knives merely to cut their meet;
therefore knives with sharp points, are for them the most
convenient. But it iz really laughable to see the Americans
adopting the use of sharp pointed knives,
without the practice of feeding themselves with forks.
They do not see the particular convenience of the custom
in France, where it originated; but it iz <i>the fashion
to uze them</i>, and this iz all they think of. They are
however well punished for their servile apishness, especially
when they are hungry; for a man may az wel
feed himself with a bodkin, az with a knife of the
present fashion.</p>

<p>Be equally careful of affectation in the use of language.
Uze words that are most common and generally
understood. Remember that sublimity and elegance
do not consist principally in words; az the modern
<span class="pb" id="Pg401">[pg 401]</span>
stile of writing would make us beleev. Sublimity
consists in grand and elevated ideas; and elegance iz
most generally found in a plain, neet, chaste phraseology.
In pronunciation be very cautious of imitating
the stage, where indeed nature <i>should be represented</i>, but
where in fact we find too much strutting, mouthing,
rant, and every kind of affectation. The modern pronunciation
of our language on the English stage iz,
beyond mezure, affected and ridiculous. The change
of <i>t</i>, <i>d</i> and <i>s</i> into <i>ch</i>, <i>j</i> and <i>sh</i>, in such words az <i>nature</i>,
<i>education</i>, <i>superstition</i>, originated in the theatrical
mouthing of words; and iz, in language, what the
stage-strut iz in walking. The practice haz indeed
spred from the stage among our polite speekers, who
hav adopted it, az peeple do other fashions, without
knowing why. Were it a matter of indifference, like
the shape of a hat, I would recommend it to your imitation;
but I hav cleerly prooved in another place,<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" title="See my Dissertations on the English Language, 4." class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
that the practice iz not vindicable on any good principles;
that on the contrary, it materially injures the
language, both in orthography and the melody of
speeking. There iz such a thing az tru and false taste,
and the latter az often directs fashion, az the former.
The <i>nachure</i> and <i>edjucation</i> of modern times are to purity
of language, what red fethers and yellow ribbons
are to elegance in dress; and could the practice be represented
with a pencil, it would be az boldly caricatured,
az the <ins class="err" title="normous" id="E401">enormous</ins> hed-dresses of 1774.</p>

<p>Do not adopt such phrases az <i>averse from</i>, <i>agreeably
to</i>, <i>going past</i>, and other modern alterations of the usual
idiom; for they are gross violations of the principles
of the language, az might be eezily prooved, were this
the place. If you are a lawyer, do not confound such
terms, az, <i>witness</i>, <i>testimony</i> and <i>evidence</i>, calling a <i>witness</i>,
an <i>evidence</i>. <i>Witness</i> iz the person testifying; <i>testimony</i>
iz what he declares in court; and <i>evidence</i> iz
the effect of that testimony in producing conviction.
Do not confound such words az, <i>genius</i> and <i>capacity</i>, or
<i>sense</i>, <i>lerning</i> and <i>knowlege</i>. <i>Genius</i> iz the power of <i>invention</i>;
<span class="pb" id="Pg402">[pg 402]</span>
<i>capacity</i>, the power of <i>receeving</i> ideas. <i>Sense</i> iz
the faculty of perception; <i>lerning</i> iz what iz obtained
in <i>books</i>; <i>knowlege</i> iz what iz acquired by <i>observation</i>.</p>

<p>Attach yourselves to bizziness in the erly part of life.
Shun idle dissipated karacters az you would the plague.
Listen to nature and reezon, and draw just ideas of
things from theze pure sources; otherwize you wil
imbibe <i>fashionable sentiments</i>, than which a more fatal
evil cannot happen to you. You wil often heer bizziness
condemned az drudgery and disgrace. Despize
the sentiment. Nature speeks a different language.
Nature tells you, "that she haz given you bodies, which
require constant exercize; that labor or some other
exercize iz essential to helth; that employment iz necessary
to peece of mind; and industry iz the meens of
acquiring property." Nature then haz rendered <i>bizziness</i>
necessary to <i>helth and happiness</i>, az wel az to <i>interest</i>;
and when men neglect her dictates, they are usually
punished with poverty, diseeze and retchedness. It
sometimes happens that a man's ancestors hav accumulated
such an estate, that he iz wel secured from
<i>poverty</i>; but the very estate he possesses, iz the meens
of entailing upon him diseeze and all its consequential
evils: For a rich man iz strongly tempted to be lazy;
and indolence, by debilitating the animal system, destroys
the power of enjoyment. Besides, a man of eezy
circumstances iz very apt to looze the virtu of self denial;
he indulges hiz appetite too freely; he becumes
an epicure in eeting, and perhaps a bakkanalian; he iz
then a slave of the worst kind, a slave to hiz own desires,
and hiz faithful services to himself are rewarded
with the gout.</p>

<p>In addition to this, he may squander away hiz estate;
and then he iz poor indeed! For a man who iz bred
in affluence, seldom haz the resolution or the knowlege
requisit to repair a broken fortune. The way to <i>keep
an estate</i>, iz to lern in youth how to <i>acquire one</i>; and
the way to <i>enjoy</i> an estate, iz to be constantly in some
bizziness which shal find employment for the faculties
of the mind. Idleness and plezure fateeg az soon az
<span class="pb" id="Pg403">[pg 403]</span>
bizziness; and indeed when bizziness haz becume
habitual, it iz the first of plezures.</p>

<p>In forming a matrimonial connection, bridle fancy,
and reduce it to the control of reezon. You wil perhaps
be in luv at sixteen; but remember, you cannot
rely on the continuance of the passion. At this erly
period of life, a man's passions are too violent to last;
he iz in raptures and ecstacy; but <i>raptures and ecstacy</i>
never continu <i>thro life</i>. While a man talks of raptures
and paradise on erth, he iz not fit to be married;
for hiz passion, or rather hiz frenzy, warps hiz judgement;
he iz az unqualified to form a just estimate of a
woman's karacter, az a blind man to judge of colors.
The probability iz, in all such cases, that a man wil
make a bad choice; at leest the chances are ten to one
against him. Before a man marries, he should liv long
enuf to experience the fallacy of hope, and to moderate
hiz expectations down to real life. He wil then meet
with fewer disappointments, and be better prepared to
realize the happiness that iz within hiz power.</p>

<p>If you feel a <i>violent</i> passion for a young lady, the
chance iz that the first opportunity you hav, you wil
discloze it, and assure her you are dying for her. Should
passion hurry you to such a declaration, before you hav
much acquaintance with her, and before you hav, by
your attentions, made some favorable impressions on
her hart, you may be sure of a repulse; for your sudden
professions frighten the lady, and ladies are never
frightened into luv. A widow wil sometimes surrender
to the most unexpected attack; but yung coy
maidens are to be taken only by gradual approaches.
To ensure success, take the advice of a very sensible
woman; "first be the frend, and then the luver." Be
polite and attentiv; show yourself a particular frend,
for ladies are not alarmed at professions of esteem; be
neether bashful, nor discuver uncommon solicitude;
and the lady's hart wil probably be yours before she
knows it.</p>

<p>Do you ask, how you shal discuver the tru karacter
of a woman, so az not to be deceeved? I answer, this
<span class="pb" id="Pg404">[pg 404]</span>
must depend mostly on obzervations of your own, or
of thoze that are more acquainted with the sex than
yourself. The virtues of good nature, delicacy, modest
rezervedness, prudence, &amp;c. are discuverable only by
considerable acquaintance. I would however advize
you to be cautious of connecting yourselves with the
following karacters: First, wimen who hav been accustomed
to indulge familiarities, even in company,
such az kissing, playing with their hands, and the like.
Secondly, thoze who wil never be seen in the morning;
for if a lady runs out of a room, and avoids you in a
morning dress, the suspicion iz that she iz a slut, and
that she iz conscious of her unfitness to be seen. A
neet woman wil never be ashamed of her dishabille,
for in this she wil show her neetness to the best advantage.
A slut may look tolerably wel in silks; but a
neet woman only wil appeer wel in a kitchen or at a
brekfast table in her own family.</p>

<p>Thirdly, never connect yourselves with a very loquacious
or fretful woman; such a partner wil teeze
you thro life. Fourthly, avoid one who haz a slanderous
tung; she wil keep your family and the naborhood
in perpetual discord. Fifthly, form no connection
with a woman, who haz no acquaintance with a
kitchen. She wil trust every thing to servants, who
wil waste more than you consume; she wil not know
how to reform abuses or guvern domestics; the clothes
wil be ill washed, the food wil be badly cooked; you
wil be harrassed with disorders and irregularity in the
family; and you wil be ashamed of your wife, if she
iz not ashamed of herself. A master of a vessel should
not <i>come in at the cabin windows</i>; nor should a man be
placed at the hed of an army, without an intimate
knowlege of the duty of a private soldier. How then
can a lady be qualified for the care of a family, without
being acquainted with every part of domestic bizziness?
Sixthly, marry, if possible, a lady of virtu and
religion; for religion iz her best gard from temptation
and the allurements of vice. At any rate, <i>marry</i>. A
<span class="pb" id="Pg405">[pg 405]</span>
<i>married man</i>, especially a <i>father</i>, iz a better citizen than
a bachelor. Hiz benevolent affections are called in to
exercize in hiz family; and he iz thus prepared to luv
and to bless society in general.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="ralign"><small>NEW YORK, 1788.</small></span></p>
<p class="center"><big><i>An</i> ADDRESS <i>to</i> YUNG LADIES.</big></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">my amiable frends</span>,</p>

<p>Altho men in general are expozed to the suspicion
of your sex, and their opinions are often construed
into flattery or stratagem, yet the tenor of the following
remarks wil, it iz presumed, bear such marks
of sincerity az to giv them a place in your confidence.
They are not the precepts of a morose instructor, nor the
opinions of a hoary sage who haz lost all relish for the
joys of life, and wishes to restrain the innocent plezures
of sense. They do not proceed from a peevish
old bachelor, whom a phlegmatic constitution, or repeeted
disappointments, hav changed into a hater of
your sex; but they come from a heart capable of being
softened by your charms or your misfortunes; a heart
that never harbored a wish but to see and make you
happy. They are the sentiments of a yung <i>frend</i>; one
who haz lived long enuf, if not to feel his <i>own</i> faults,
at leest to <i>discuver</i> thoze of others; and to form a tolerable
estimate of your worth in social life.</p>

<p>Our Saviour, when on erth, took a child in hiz
arms and said, "of such iz the kingdom of heaven."
I never view a circle of little misses without recollecting
the divine comparison. A collection of sweet little
beings, with voices az melodious az the notes of the
nightingale, whoze cheeks even a whisper wil cuver
with blushes, and whoze hearts are az pure az the falling
snow drop; iz heaven in miniature. Such iz the
description of my little female frends in the bloom of
childhood. To prezerve that delicacy of mind, which
nature furnishes; which constitutes the glory of your
sex, and forms the principal gard of your own virtue,
iz the bizziness of education. In this article, you hav
<span class="pb" id="Pg407">[pg 407]</span>
an opportunity to display the excellence of your character,
and to exert your talents most successfully in benefitting
society.</p>

<p>A woman without delicacy, iz a woman without
reputation; for chastity really exists in the mind; and
when this fountain iz pure, the words and actions that
flow from it, wil be chaste and delicate. Yung misses
therefore should be remooved az far az possible from
all company that can taint their minds, or accustom
them to indecency of any kind. Their nurses, their
companions, their teechers, should be selected from
peeple of at leest uncorrupted morals and amiable manners.</p>

<p>But a more advanced stage of life, the time when
yung ladies enter into society, iz, with respect to their
future reputation, a period extremely critical. Little, my
deer friends, do you reflect, how important iz the manner
in which you enter into life. Prudery and coquetry
are extremes equally to be shunned, becauze both
are equally disagreeable to our sex, and fatal to your
reputations. It haz been said that coquetts often looze
their reputation, while they retain their virtu; and that
prudes often prezerve their reputation, after they hav
lost their virtu. I would only add this remark, that
coquetts are <i>generally</i>, but prudes <i>almost always</i> suspected;
and suspicion iz az fatal to a female karacter, az a
crime. Iz this unjust? Coquetry and prudery are both
affectation; every species of affectation dezerves punishment;
and when persons relinquish their own natural
karacters for thoze which are borrowed, iz it unjust
to suspect their motivs, az a punishment for the
offence?</p>

<p>You are taught to suspect the man who flatters you.
But your good sense wil very eezily distinguish between
expressions of mere civility and declarations of real esteem.
In general one rule holds, that the man who iz
most lavish in declarations of esteem and admiration,
luvs and admires you the leest. A profusion of flattery
iz real ground for suspicion. Reel esteem iz evinced
<span class="pb" id="Pg408">[pg 408]</span>
by a uniform course of polite respectful behaviour.
This iz a proof on which you may depend; it iz a
flattery the most grateful to a lady of understanding,
because it must proceed from a real respect for her karacter
and virtues.</p>

<p>Permit me here to suggest one caution. You are
told that unmeening flattery iz an insult to your understandings,
and sometimes you are apt to resent it.
This should be done with great prudence. Precipitate
resentment iz dangerous; it may not be dezerved at
the time; it may make you an enemy; it may giv uneeziness
to a frend; it may giv your own harts pain; it
may injure you by creating a suspicion that it iz all affectation.
The common place civilities of dangling
beaux may be very trifling and disagreeable, but can
rarely amount to an insult, or dezerve more than indifference
and neglect. Resentment of such trifles can
hardly be a mark of tru dignity of soul.</p>

<p>At this period of life, let the prime excellence of
your karacters, <i>delicacy</i>, be discuvered in all your words
and actions. Permit me, az one acquainted at leest
with the sentiments of my own sex, to assure you, that
a man never respects a woman, who does not respect
herself. The moment a woman suffers to fall from
her tung, any expressions that indicate the leest indelicacy
of mind; the moment she ceeses to blush at such
expressions from our sex, she ceeses to be respected;
becauze az a lady, she iz no longer respectable. Whatever
familiarity of conversation may be vindicable or
pardonable in ether sex alone, there iz, in mixed companies,
a sacred decorum that should not be violated by
one rude idea. And however dispozed the ladies may
be to overlook small transgressions in our sex, yet unforgiving
man cannot eezily forget the offences of yours,
especially when thoze offences discuver a want of all
that renders you lovely.</p>

<p>If your <i>words</i> are to be so strictly watched, how
much more attention iz necessary to render your <i>conduct</i>
unexceptionable. You charge our sex, with being
the seducers, the betrayers of yours. Admit the charge
<span class="pb" id="Pg409">[pg 409]</span>
to be partially tru, yet let us be candid. Az profligate
az many of our sex are acknowleged to be, it iz but justice
to say, that very few are so abandoned az to attempt
deliberately the seduction of an artless and innocent
lady, who shows, by her conduct, that she iz conscious
of the worth of her reputation, and that she respects
her own karacter. I hav rarely found a libertine who
had impudence enuf to assail virtue, that had not been
expozed by some improprieties of conduct. There iz
something so commanding in virtu, that even villans
respect her, and dare not approach her temples but in
the karacter of her votaries.</p>

<p>But when a woman iz incautious, when she iz reddy
to fall into the arms of any man that approaches her,
when she suffers double entendres, indecent hints and
conversation to flow from her lips in mixed companies,
she remooves the barriers of her reputation, she disarms
herself, and thousands consider themselves at liberty to
commence an attack.</p>

<p>When so much depends on your principles and reputation;
when we expect to derive all the happiness
of the married life from that source, can it be a crime
to wish for some proof of your virtu before the indissoluble
connection iz formed? Iz that virtu to be
trusted which haz never been tempted? Iz it absurd
to say that an attack may be made even with honorable
intentions? Admit the absurdity; but such attempts
are often made, and may end in your ruin.
The man may then be retched in hiz mistake becauze
he iz disappointed in hiz opinion and expectations. Be
assured, my frends, that even vile man cannot but esteem
the woman who respects herself. We look to
you, in a world of vice, for that delicacy of mind, that
innocence of life, which render <i>you</i> lovely and <i>ourselves</i>
happy.</p>

<p>Do you wish for admiration? But admiration iz az
transient az the blaze of a meteor. Ladies who hav
the most admirers, are often the last to find valuable
partners.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg410">[pg 410]</span>
Do you wish to be esteemed and luved? It iz eezy
to render yourselves esteemable and lovely. It iz only
by retaining that softness of manners, that obliging and
delicate attention to every karacter, which, whether
natural or acquired, are at some period of life, the property
of almost every female. Beauty and money, without
merit, will sometimes command eligible connections;
but such connections do not answer the wishes of our
hearts; they do not render us happy. Lerning, or an
acquaintance with books, may be a very agreeable or a
very disagreeable accomplishment, in proportion to the
discretion of the lady who possesses it. Properly employed,
it iz highly satisfactory to the lady and her connections;
but I beleev obzervation wil confirm my
conjecture, that a strong attachment to books in a lady,
often deters a man from approaching her with the offer
of hiz heart. This iz ascribed to the pride of our
sex. That the imputation iz always false, I wil not
aver; but I undertake to say, that if pride iz the cauze,
it iz supported by the order of nature.</p>

<p>One sex iz formed for the more hardy exercizes of
the council, the field and the laborious employments of
procuring subsistence. The other, for the superintendance
of domestic concerns, and for diffusing bliss thro
social life. When a woman quits her own department,
she offends her husband, not merely becauze she
obtrudes herself upon <i>hiz</i> bizziness, but becauze she
departs from that sphere which iz assigned <i>her</i> in the
order of society; becauze she neglects <i>her</i> duty, and
leeves <i>her own</i> department vacant. The same remark
wil apply to the man who visits the kitchen and gets
the name of a <i>betty</i>. The same principle which excludes
a man from an attention to domestic bizziness,
excludes a woman from law, mathematics and astronomy.
Eech sex feels a degree of pride in being best
qualified for a particular station, and a degree of resentment
when the other encroaches upon their privilege.
This iz acting conformably to the constitution
of society. A woman would not willingly marry a man
who iz strongly inclined to pass hiz time in seeing the
<span class="pb" id="Pg411">[pg 411]</span>
house and furniture in order, in superintending the
cooks, or in working gauze and tiffany; for she would
predict, with some certainty, that he would neglect hiz
proper bizziness. In the same manner, a man iz cautious
of forming a connection with a woman, whoze
predilection for the sciences might take her attention
from necessary family concerns.</p>

<p>Ladies however are not generally charged with a too
strong attachment to books. It iz necessary that they
should be wel acquainted with every thing that respects
life and manners; with a knowlege of the human hart
and the graceful accomplishments. The greatest misfortune
iz, that your erly studies are not always wel directed;
and you are permitted to devour a thousand
volumes of fictitious nonsense, when a smaller number
of books, at less trubble and expense, would furnish
you with more valuable trezures of knowlege.</p>

<p>To be <i>lovely</i> then you must be content to be <i>wimen</i>;
to be mild, social and sentimental; to be acquainted
with all that belongs to your department, and leeve the
masculine virtues, and the profound researches of study,
to the province of the other sex.</p>

<p>That it may be necessary, for political purposes, to
consider man az the superior in authority, iz to me
probable. I question whether a different maxim would
not destroy your own happiness.</p>

<p>A man iz pleezed with the deference hiz wife shows
for hiz opinions; he often loves her even for her want
of information, when it creates a kind of dependence
upon hiz judgement. On the other hand, a woman
always despises her husband for hiz inferiority in understanding
and knowlege, and blushes at the figure he
makes in the company of men who possess superior
talents. Do not theze facts justify the order of society,
and render some difference in rank between the sexes,
necessary to the happiness of both? But this superiority
iz comparativ, and in some mezure, mutual. In
many things, the woman iz az much superior to her
husband, az he iz to her, in any article of information.
They depend on eech other, and the assumption of any
<span class="pb" id="Pg412">[pg 412]</span>
prerogativ or superiority in domestic life, iz a proof
that the union iz not perfect; it iz a strong evidence
the parties <i>are</i> not, or <i>wil</i> not be happy.</p>

<p>Ladies are often ridiculed for their loquaciousness.
But ridicule iz not the worst punishment of this fault.
However witty, sprightly and sentimental your conversation
may be, depend on it, az a maxim that holds
without exception, that the person who talks incessantly,
wil soon ceese to be respected. From congress to
private families, the remark iz tru, that a man or woman
who talks much, loozes all influence. To your sex,
talkativness iz very injurious; for a man wil hardly
ever chooze a noizy loquacious woman for hiz companion.
A delicate rezerv iz a becuming, a commanding
characteristic of an amiable woman; the want of
which no brilliant accomplishments wil supply. A
want of ability to converse, iz scarcely so much censured,
az a want of discretion to know when to speek
and when to be silent.</p>

<p>In the choice of husbands, my fair reeders, what
shall I say? It haz been said or insinuated, that you
prefer men of inferior talents. This iz not tru. You
are sensible that a good address and a respectful attention,
are the qualities which most generally recommend
to the esteem of both sexes. A philosopher, who iz
absent and stupid, wil not please az a companion; but
of two persons equal in other respects, the man of superior
talents iz your choice. If my obzervations hav
not deceeved me, you pride yourselves in being connected
with men of eminence. I mention this to contradict
the opinion maintained in the Lounger, that ladies
giv a sort of preference to men of inferior talents.
The opinion wants extension and qualification; it extends
to both sexes, when tru, but iz never tru, except
when men of talents are destitute of social accomplishments.</p>

<p>Money iz the great object of desire with both sexes;
but how few obtain it by marriage? With respect to
our sex, I confess, it iz not much to a man's credit to
seek a fortune without any exertions of hiz own; but
<span class="pb" id="Pg413">[pg 413]</span>
the ladies often make a capital mistake in the meens of
obtaining their object. They ask, <i>what iz a man's fortune</i>?
Whereas, if they are in pursuit of welth, solid
permanent welth, they should ask, <i>is he a man of bizziness</i>?
<i>Of talents?</i> <i>Of persevering industry?</i> <i>Does he
know the use of money?</i> The difference in the two cases
iz this: The man of fortune, who haz not formed a
habit of acquiring property, iz generally ignorant of
the use of it. He not only spends it, but he spends it
without system or advantage, and often dies a poor
man. But the man who knows how to <i>acquire</i> property,
generally keeps hiz expenditures within hiz income;
in exerting hiz talents to <i>obtain</i>, he forms a habit
of <i>uzing</i> hiz property to advantage, and commonly enjoys
life az wel in <i>accumulating</i> an estate, az the man
of fortune does in <i>dissipating</i> one. My idea iz breefly
this; that the woman who marries a man of bizziness,
with very little property, haz a better chance for
a fortune in middle life and old age, than one who
marries a rich man who livs in idleness.</p>

<p>After all, ladies, it depends much on yourselves to determin,
whether your families shall enjoy eezy circumstances.
Any man may acquire something by hiz application;
but <i>economy</i>, the most difficult article in conducting
domestic concerns, iz the womans province.</p>

<p>You see with what frankness and candor I tell you
my opinions. This iz undoutedly the best mode of
conducting social intercourse, and particularly our intercourse
with the fairest part of the creation.</p>

<p>I rite from feeling; from obzervation; from experience.
The sexes, while eech keep their proper
sphere, cannot fail to render eech other social and happy.
But frail az yours iz commonly represented, you
may not only boast of a superior share of virtu yourselves,
but of garding and cherishing ours. You hav
not only an interest in being good for your <i>own</i> sakes,
but <i>society</i> iz interested in your goodness; you polish
our manners, correct our vices, and inspire our harts
with a love of virtue. Can a man who loves an amiable
woman, abandon himself to vices which she abhors?
<span class="pb" id="Pg414">[pg 414]</span>
May your influence over our sex be increesed;
not merely the influence of beauty and gay accomplishments,
but the influence of your virtues, whoze
dominion controls the evils, and multiplies the blessings
of society.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> In our colleges and universities, students read some of
the ancient Poets and Orators; but the Historians,
which are perhaps more valuable, are generally neglected.
The student just begins to read Latin and Greek
to advantage, then quits the study. Where is the seminary,
in which the students read Herodotus, Thucydides,
Xenophon, Polybius, Dionysius Halicarnasseus,
Livy, Velleius, Paterculus and Tacitus? How superficial
must be that learning, which is acquired in four
years! Severe experience has taught me the errors and
defects of what is called a liberal education. I could
not read the best Greek and Roman authors while in
college, without neglecting the established classical studies;
and after I left college, I found time only to dip
into books, that every scholar should be master of; a
circumstance that often fills me with the deepest regret.

an intimate acquaintance with the man. The same principle
is observable in the body. High seasoned food, without frequent
intervals of abstinence, loses its relish. On the other
hand, objects that make slight impressions at first, acquire
strength by repetition. An elegant simplicity in a building
may not affect the mind with great pleasure at first light; but
the pleasure will always increase with repeated examinations
of the structure. Thus by habit, we become excessively fond
of food which does not relish at first tasting; and strong attachments
between the sexes often take place from indifference,
and even from aversion.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> How different this practice from the manner of educating
youth in Rome, during the flourishing ages of the republic!
There the attention to children commenced with their birth;
an infant was not educated in the cottage of a hireling nurse,
but in the very bosom of its mother, whose principal praise
was, that she superintended her family. Parents were careful
to choose some aged matron to take care of their children; to
form their first habits of speaking and acting; to watch their
growing passions, and direct them to their proper objects; to
guard them from all immodest sports, preserve their minds innocent,
and direct their attention to liberal pursuits.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Filius&mdash;non in cella emptÃ¦ nutricis sed gremio ac sinu
matris educabatur, cujus prÃ¦cipua laus, tueri domum, et inservire
liberis. Eligebatur autem aliqua major natu propinqua,
cujus probatis spectatisque moribus, omnis cujuspiam
familiÃ¦ soboles committeretur, coram qua neque dicere fas erat
quod turpe dictu, neque facere quod inhonestum factu videretur.
Ac non studia modo curasque, sed remissiones etiam lusus que
puerorum, sanctitate quadam ac verecundia temperabat."
In this manner were educated the Gracchi, CÃ¦sar, and other
celebrated Romans. "QuÃ¦ disciplina ac severitas eo pertinebat,
ut sincera et interga et nullis pravitatibus detorta unius
cujusque natura, toto statem pectore, arriperet artes honestas."&mdash;&mdash; <i>Tacitus
de Orat. Dial. 28.</i></p>

<p>The historian then proceeds to mention the corruption of
manners, and the vicious mode of Education, in the later ages
of Rome. He says, children were committed to some maid,
with the vilest slaves; with whom they were initiated in their
low conversation and manners. "Horum fabulis et erroribus
teneri slatim et rudes animi imbuuntur; nec quis quam in toto
domo pensi habet, quid coram infante domino aut dicat aut
faciat."&mdash;&mdash; <i>Ibid. 29.</i></p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The practice of employing low characters in schools is not
novel&mdash;Ascham, preceptor to Queen Elizabeth, gives us the
following account of the practice in his time. "Pity it is that
commonly more care is had; yea and that among very wise
men, to find out rather a cunning man for their horse, than a
cunning man for their children. They say, nay, in word; but
they do so, in deed. For to one they will give a stipend of
two hundred crowns, and loth to offer the other two hundred
shillings. God, that sitteth in the Heaven, laugheth their
choice to scorn and rewardeth their liberality as it should: for
he suffereth them to have <i>tame</i> and <i>well ordered horses</i>; but
<i>wild</i> and <i>unfortunate children</i>: and therefore in the end they
find more pleasure in their horse, than comfort in their child."</p>

<p>This is <i>old language</i>, but the facts stated are <i>modern truths</i>.
The barbarous Gothic practice has survived all the attacks of
common sense, and in many parts of America, a gentleman's
groom is on a level with his schoolmaster, in point of reputation.
But hear another authority for the practice in England.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> It is worthy of remark, that in proportion as laws are favorable
to the equal rights of men, the number of crimes in a
state is diminished; except where the human mind is debased by
extreme servitude, or by superstition. In France, there are but
few crimes; religion and the rigor of a military force prevent
them; perhaps also, ignorance in the peasantry may be assigned
as another reason. But in England and Ireland the human
mind is not so depressed, yet the distribution of property and
honors is not equal; the lower classes of people, bold and independent,
as well as poor, feel the injuries which flow from
the feudal system, even in its relaxed state; they become desperate,
and turn highwaymen. Hence those kingdoms produce
more culprits than half Europe besides.</p>

<p>The character of the Jews, as sharpers, is derived from the
cruel and villanous proscriptions, which they have suffered
from the bigotry of Christians in every part of Europe.</p>

<p>Most of the criminals condemned in America are foreigners.
The execution of a native, before the revolution, was a novelty.
The distribution of property in America and the principles
of government favor the rights of men; and but few men
will commence enemies to society and government, if they can
receive the benefits of them. Unjust governments and tyrannical
distinctions have made most of the villains that ever
existed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> It has been already observed that a child always imitates
what he sees and hears: For this reason, he should hear no
language which is not correct and decent. Every word spoken
to a child, should be pronounced with clearness and propriety.
Banish from children all diminutive words, all whining
and all bad grammar. A boy of six years old may be taught
to speak as correctly, as Cicero did before the Roman Senate.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Nothing can be more fatal to domestic happiness in America,
than a taste for copying the luxurious manners and amusements
of England and France. Dancing, drawing and
music, are principal articles of education in those kingdoms;
therefore every girl in America must pass two or three years
at a boarding school, tho her father cannot give her a farthing
when she marries. This ambition to educate females above
their fortunes pervades every part of America. Hence
the disproportion between the well bred females and the males
in our large towns. A mechanic or shopkeeper in town, or a
farmer in the country, whose sons get their living by their
father's employments, will send their daughters to a boarding
school, where their ideas are elevated, and their views carried
above a connexion with men in those occupations. Such an education,
without fortune or beauty, may possibly please a girl
of fifteen, but must prove her greatest misfortune. This fatal
mistake is illustrated in every large town in America. In
the country, the number of males and females, is nearly equal;
but in towns, the number of genteelly bred women is
greater than of men; and in some towns, the proportion is, as
three to one.</p>

<p>The heads of young people of both sexes are often turned
by reading descriptions of splendid living, of coaches, of plays,
and other amusements. Such descriptions excite a desire to
enjoy the same pleasures. A fortune becomes the principal
object of pursuit; fortunes are scarce in America, and not easily
acquired; disappointment succeeds, and the youth who
begins life with expecting to enjoy a coach, closes the prospect
with a small living, procured by labor and economy.</p>

<p>Thus a wrong education, and a taste for pleasures which our
fortune will not enable us to enjoy, often plunge the Americans
into distress, or at least prevent early marriages. Too
fond of show, of dress and expense, the sexes wish to please
each other; they mistake the means, and both are disappointed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Cicero was twenty eight years old when he left Italy to
travel into Greece and Asia. "He did not stir abroad," says
Dr. Middleton, "till he had completed his education at home;
for nothing can be more pernicious to a nation, than the necessity
of a foreign one."&mdash;<i>Life of Cicero, vol. 1. p. 48.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Moore makes a remark precisely in point. Speaking of
a foreign education, proposed by a certain Lord, who objected
to the public schools in England, he says, "I have attended to
his Lordship's objections, and after due consideration, and
weighing every circumstance, I remain of opinion, that no country
but Great Britain is proper for the education of a British
subject, who proposes to pass his life in his own country. The
most important point, in my mind, to be secured in the education
of a young man of rank of our country, is to make him an
Englishman; and this can be done no where so effectually as
in England." See his <i>View of Society and Manners</i>, &amp;c. vol. 1,
page 197, where the reader will find many judicious remarks
upon this subject. The following are too pertinent to be
omitted.&mdash;"It is thought, that by an early foreign education,
all ridiculous English prejudices, will be avoided. This may be
true; but other prejudices, perhaps as ridiculous, and much
more detrimental, will be formed. The first cannot be attended
with many inconveniencies; the second may render the young
people unhappy in their own country when they return, and disagreeable
to their countrymen all the rest of their lives." These
remarks, by a change of names are applicable to America.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Not that the English nation was originally in slavery; for
the primitiv Saxons and Germans were free. But the military
tenures, established by the Gothic conquests, depressed the
people; so that under the rigor of the feudal system, about the

in extreme servitude. From this depression, the English
have gradually emerged into ancient freedom.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> The <i>nominal</i> distinction of <i>Convention</i> and <i>Legislature</i> was
probably copied from the English; but the American distinction
goes farther, it implies, in common acceptation, a difference
of <i>power</i>. This difference does not exist in G. Britain.
The assembly of Lords and Commons which restored Charles
II, and that which raised the Prince of Orange to the throne,
were called <i>Conventions</i>, or <i>parliamentary Conventions</i>. But the
difference between these Conventions and an ordinary Parliament,
is merely a difference in the manner of assembling; a <i>Convention</i>
being an assembly or meeting of Lords and Commons, on
an emergency, without the King's writ, which is the regular
constitutional mode of summoning them, and by custom necessary
to render the meeting a <i>Parliament</i>. But the powers of this assembly,
whether denominated a <i>Convention</i> or a <i>Parliament</i>, have
ever been considered as coextensive and supreme. I would
just remark further, that the impossibility of establishing perpetual,
or even permanent forms of government, is proved already
by the experience of two States in America. Pensylvania
and Georgia, have suffered under bad Constitutions, till they
are glad to go thro the process of calling a new Convention.
After the new forms of government have been tried some time,
the people will discover new defects, and must either call a third
Convention, or let the governments go on without amendment,
because their Legislatures, which ought to have supreme power,
cannot make altertations.&mdash;&mdash;[1789.]</p></div>

people, I suppoze, solemnly resolved, that there was no power
in the State which <ins class="err" title="would" id="E054">could</ins> accept the resignation. The resolv
was grounded on the idea that the power of the people
is paramount to that of the Legislature; whereas the people
hav no power at all, except in choosing representativs. All
Legislativ and Executiv powers are vested in their Representativs,
in Councilor Assembly, and the Council should have accepted
the resignation and issued a precept for another choice.

school, and then let the children know that he is a mere <i>servant</i>.
The consequence is, the children despise him and his rules, and
a constant war is maintained between the master and his pupils.
The boys think themselves more respectable than the master,
and the master has the rod in his hand, which he never fails to
exercise. A proper degree of respect for the man and his laws,
would prevent a thousand hard knocks. This is <i>government in

despising their laws.</p></div>

liberty to lay out a highway or build a bridge; an affair in
which the State at large has very little interest, and of the necessity
and utility of which the Legislature are not suitable judges.
This occasions much trouble for the State; it is a needless expense.

the arrival of the Count in the Chesapeak was predetermined
and expected by General Washington, and consequently all
the preparations to attack New York a mere finesse to deceive
the enemy; or whether the real intention was against New
York, and the siege of Yorktown planned upon the unexpected
arrival of the French fleet in the bay. The following
letter will let the matter in its true light.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="ralign"><i>Mount Vernon, July 31, 1788.</i></span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I duly received your letter of the 14th instant, and can
only answer you briefly and generally from memory; that a
combined operation of the land and naval forces of France in
America, for the year 1781, was preconcerted the year before;
that the point of attack was not absolutely agreed upon,<a name="FNanchor_b" id="FNanchor_b" href="#Footnote_b" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> because
it could not be foreknown where the enemy would be
most susceptible of impression; and because we (having the
command of the water with sufficient means of conveyance)
could transport ourselves to any spot with the greatest celerity;
that it was determined by me, nearly twelve months before
hand, at all hazards, to give out and cause it to be believed by
the highest military as well as civil officers, that New York
was the destined place of attack, for the important purpose of
inducing the eastern and middle States to make greater exertions
in furnishing specific supplies, than they otherwise would
have done, as well as for the interesting purpose of rendering
the enemy less prepared elsewhere; that by these means, and
these alone, artillery, boats, stores, and provisions, were in
seasonable preparation to move with the utmost rapidity to
any part of the continent; for the difficulty consisted more in
providing, than knowing how to apply the military apparatus;
that before the arrival of the Count de Grasse, it was the fixed
determination <i>to strike the enemy in the most vulnerable quarter</i>,
so as to ensure success with moral certainty, as our affairs
were then in the most ruinous train imaginable; that New
York was thought to be beyond our effort, and consequently
that the only hesitation that remained, was between an attack
upon the British army in Virginia and that in Charleston:
And finally, that, by the intervention of several communications,
and some incidents which cannot be detailed in a letter,
the hostile post in Virginia, from being a <i>provisional and strongly
expected</i>, became the <i>definitiv and certain object</i> of the campaign.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_b" id="Footnote_b" href="#FNanchor_b"><span class="label">[b]</span></a> Because it would be easy for the Count de Grasse, in good time before
his departure from the West Indies, to giv notice, by expressing at
what place he could most conveniently first touch to receive advice.</p></div>

<p>I only add, that it never was in contemplation to attack
New York, unless the garrison should first have been so far
degarnished to carry on the southern operations, as to render
our success in the siege of that place, as infallible as any future
military event can ever be made. For I repeat it, and dwell
upon it again, some splendid advantage (whether upon a larger
or smaller scale was almost immaterial) was so essentially
necessary, to revive the expiring hopes and languid exertions
of the country, at the crisis in question, that I never would
have consented to embark in any enterprise, wherein, from
the most rational plan and accurate calculations, the favorable
issue should not have appeared as clear to my view as a ray of
light. The failure of an attempt against the posts of the enemy,
could, in no other possible situation during the war, have
been so fatal to our cause.</p>

<p>That much trouble was taken and finesse used to misguide
and bewilder Sir Henry Clinton, in regard to the real object,
by fictitious communications, as well as by making a deceptiv
provision of ovens, forage, and boats, in his neighborhood,
is certain: Nor were less pains taken to deceive our own army;
for I had always conceived, where the imposition did not
completely take place at home, it could never sufficiently succeed
abroad.</p>

<p>Your desire of obtaining truth, is very laudable; I wish I
had more leisure to gratify it, as I am equally solicitous the
undisguised verity should be known. Many circumstances
will unavoidably be misconceived and misrepresented. Notwithstanding
most of the papers, which may properly be deemed
official, are preserved; yet the knowlege of innumerable
things, of a more delicate and secret nature, is confined to the
perishable remembrance of some few of the present generation.</p>

<p>With esteem, I am, Sir, your most obedient humble servant,</p>

heaps</i>, as they are called, is proved by a ludicrous practice,
that prevails among the Anglo Americans in the vicinity, of
making strangers pull off their hats as they pass by this grave.
A man passing by with one who is a stranger to the custom,
never fails to practise a jest upon him, by telling him that a
spider, a caterpillar, or some other insect is upon his hat; the
unsuspecting traveller immediately takes off his hat, to brush
away the offending insect, and finds by a roar of laughter, that
a trick is put upon him. I have often seen this trick played
upon strangers, and upon the neighbors who happen to be off
their guard, to the great amusement of the country people.
The jest, however, is a proof that the aborigines paid a respect
to these rude monuments, and in ridicule of that respect, probably,
originated the vulgar practice of the English, which exists
to this day.</p></div>

<p>The truth is this; the particles of water are constantly exhaled
from the earth by the heat of the sun. During the day
time, these particles ascend in an imperceptible manner, and
furnish the atmosphere with the materials of clouds and rain.
But in the night, the atmosphere grows cool, while the earth,
retaining a superior degree of heat, continues to throw off the
particles of water. These particles, meeting the colder atmosphere,
are condensed, and lodge upon the surface of the earth,
grass, trees and other objects. So that the expression, <i>the dew
falls</i>, is in a degree true, altho it <i>first rises</i> from the earth.</p></div>

the <i>principes</i> were electiv; and therefore could not hav owned
the land (pagus) or exercised the office of judge in right of
their property. The kings, princes, and generals of the ancient
Germans were elected; some for their <i>nobility</i>, that iz,
the respectability of their families, arising from the valor and
merits of their ancestors; others, az their <i>duces</i>, military commanders,
were chosen for their <i>virtues</i>, their personal bravery.
This I take to be the meening of that passage in Tacitus,
"Reges ex nobilitate, duces ex virtute sumunt."</p>

<p>"The <i>Comites ex plebe</i>," says Selden, chap. 18, "made one
rank of freemen superior to the rest in wisdom." The Saxon
nobles were called <i>adelingi</i>, or wel born; the freemen, <i>frilingi</i>,
or free born; the latter might be assistants in the judicial department.
The lower ranks were called <i>lazzi</i> or slaves; and
indolence iz so necessary a consequence of bondage, that this
word <i>lazzi</i>, or <i>lazy</i>, haz become sinonimous with <i>indolent</i>, <i>sluggish</i>.
This word iz a living national satire upon every species
of slavery. But the effect of slavery iz not merely indolence;
its natural tendency iz to produce <i>dishonesty</i>; "almost every
slave, being, says Dr. Franklin, from the nature of hiz employment,
a theef." Az a striking proof of this, we may instance
the change of meening in the words <i>villain</i> and <i>knave</i>,
which at first denoted <i>tenant</i> and <i>plowman</i>, but during the oppressions
of the feudal system, come to signify, <i>a rogue</i>. <i>Vassal</i>
also denoted originally, a <i>tenant</i> or <i>feudatory</i> of a superior lord.
It waz an honorable name, the barons being called the kings
<i>vassals</i>. But servitude iz to natural a consequence of the tenure
of lands under a <ins class="corr" title="propietor" id="C265n">proprietor</ins>, in see, that <i>vassal</i> haz become
sinonimous with slave.<a name="FNanchor_c" id="FNanchor_c" href="#Footnote_c" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> The change of meening in theze
words iz a volum of instruction to princes and legislators.
Reduce men to bondage, and they hav no motiv but feer to
keep them industrious and honest, and of course, most of them
commence rogues and drones. Why hav not the tyrants of
Europe discovered this truth? Good laws, and an equal distribution
of the advantages and the rights of government,
would generally be an effectual substitute for the bayonet and
the gallows. Look thro Europe; wherever we see poverty
and oppression, there we find a nursery of villains. A difference
in the property, education and advantages, originates the
difference of character, between the nobleman of nicest honor,
and the culprits that swing at Tyburn.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_123" id="Footnote_123" href="#FNanchor_123"><span class="label">[123]</span></a> Selden waz forced to confess the <i>jure consulti</i> and <i>Ã¦tate superiores</i>,
so often mentioned in the Saxon laws, az composing
the homage or jury of twelv, to hav been <i>cheef men both for
experience and knowlege</i>. To such as <i>stumble at this conceet</i>, as
he expresses it, he remarks that the work of jurors requires
them to be cheef men, az they <i>judge of matter of fact</i>; (a reezon
drawn from the modern notions of jurymen's province.) And
he adds, the jurors, who were co-assessors, with the bishop or
sheriff in the court, were seeted in the most eminent place, and
might hav held it to this day, az they do in Sweden, had the
<i>cheef men</i> still holden the service. But the great became negligent
of such public duties, and left the business to thoze of a
meener condition, who would not or durst not take the bench;
and therefore took their seets on the floor&mdash;(took separate
seets.) He says further, that the Danes, on their settlement
in England, would not associate with men of this condition; so
that a compromise took place between Alfred, the Saxon king,
and Gunthrune, the Dane, by which it waz decreed, that a
lord or baron should be tried by twelv lords, and one of inferior
rank, by <i>eleven of his equals</i> and <i>one lord</i>. This waz in
the case of homicide only; tho afterwards the law might extend
to other cases and civil suits. By hiz own account of the
matter, this writer supposes the trial by <i>twelv</i> waz originally
a trial by the <i>cheef men</i>, (<i>thanes lahmen</i>) and the idea of equality
waz never suggested in the practice till the ninth or tenth century.
But juries existed az courts for centuries before; and
the word <i>peers</i> iz acknowleged to hav had its origin on the
continent, where it signified the lords or members of the high
court instituted by Charlemagne. In modern use, trial by
<i>peers</i> iz trial by equals <i>generally</i>; for men are mostly become
freemen and landholders; but this waz not the primitiv practice;
nor was <i>equality</i> the basis of the institution. Even if we
suppose the word peer to hav signified <i>equal</i>, as uzed originally
on the continent, it extended no privilege on that account to
the body of the nations where it waz used; for it ment only
the <i>kings equals</i>, hiz <i>comites</i>, hiz dukes, erls and barons, among
whom he waz merely <i>primus inter pares</i>. In England Bracton,
who wrote under Henry III, declares the king waz considered
in this light; and that the "<i>erls and barons are his associates</i>,
who ought to bridle him, when the law does not."<a name="FNanchor_f" id="FNanchor_f" href="#Footnote_f" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> The
courts then which Charlemagne instituted in France and Germany,
consisted merely of the kings <i>peers</i> or <i>equals</i>; and in
theze countries, the courts remain mostly on the ancient footing;
so that none but the nobility can be tried by their <i>equals</i>.
In this sense of the word therefore juries were not used in
England, till the compromise between Alfred and Gunthrune,
about the year 900. Before that period, the jurors were not
called or considered az <i>equals</i>; but they were <i>thanes</i>, <i>jure consulti</i>,
<i>lahmen</i> and <i>clergymen</i>. A distinction afterwards took
place, and lords were tried by <i>their</i> equals, and commoners by
<i>theirs</i>.</p>

equity over the whole kingdom, in all matters of great and
general concern. But this court waz composed of lords, bishops,
and <i>majores natu</i> or <i>sapientes</i>, men respected for their age
and lerning, who were of the rank of <i>freemen</i>. All the freemen
were bound also to do suit in the lords court, and to attend

<p>The vast powers of the county court, when the freeholders

by two facts. One, the conquerors half-brother, and
Lanfrank, archbishop of Canterbury, had a dispute about certain
lands and tenements in Kent. The archbishop petitioned
the king, who issued hiz writ, and summoned the freemen of
the county, to take cognizance of the suit. After three days
trial, the freemen gave judgement for the archbishop, and the

be resolved into the wil of Deity, because society itself depends
on hiz wil. This iz conceded; I only contend that moral fitness

beings, with relation to eech other, and not from any arbitrary

why the exports of that article do not exceed thoze of Ireland.
Most of the laboring peeple in New England eet meet twice a
day, and az much az their appetites demand. Suppose eech
person to eet but six ounces a day on an average, which iz a low
estimate, and the inhabitants of New England consume more
than <i>one hundred million</i> pounds of meet, in a yeer. I do not
know what proportion of this iz beef, but the greatest part iz
beef and pork, worth <i>two pence</i>, and <i>two pence half penny</i> a
pound. By the best accounts from Ireland, it iz probable the
inhabitants do not consume a <i>twentieth part</i> of the meet, consumed
in the northern states, in proportion to their numbers.
But suppoze they consume a <i>tenth</i>; let the New England peeple
reduce the consumption of meet in the same proportion,
and they would save <i>ninety millions</i> for exportation. This at
two pence a pound makes the sum of <i>two million five hundred
thousand dollars</i>, which iz a very handsome commercial income.
Let the reduction proceed to all kinds of food and clothing;
let our common peeple liv like the poor of Ireland in <i>all respects</i>,
and they would save twice the sum. I would not recommend
this to my countrymen; I wish them to enjoy good
eeting and drinking. But I make theze estimates to show them
that they never wil hav much <i>money</i>; for they eet and drink
all they ern.</p></div>

that the heeling art waz not cultivated, and scarcely known
among the old Romans. For several ages from the bilding of
Rome, there iz hardly any mention made of a physician.
Pliny relates, that Rome flurished, six hundred yeers, without
physicians; that iz, the profession waz not honorable, being
confined to servants or other low karacters. In Seneca's time,
many of theze had acquired estates by the bizziness; but they
were stil held in no estimation. "Bona in arte medendi humillimisque
quibus contingere videmus." After the conquest
of Greece and Asia, the manners of the Romans were corrupted
by the luxuries of the eest; diseeses multiplied, and the
practice of physic became more necessary and more reputable;
but the art of surgery waz not separated from that of medicin,
til the times of the emperors.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_169" id="Footnote_169" href="#FNanchor_169"><span class="label">[169]</span></a> The ancients were wiser than the moderns in many respects;
and particularly in restraining certain vices by <i>opinion</i>,
rather than by <i>positiv injunctions</i>. Duelling and profane swearing
are prohibited by the laws of most countries; yet penalties
hav no effect in preventing the crimes, whilst they are not
followed by loss of reputation. Vices which do not immediately
affect the lives, honor or property of men, which are not
<i><ins class="corr" title="'ma la" id="C395n">mala</ins> in se</i>, which are eezily conceeled, or which are supported
by a principle of honor or reputation, are not restrainable by
law. Under some of theze description fall, duelling, profane
swearing, gambling, &amp;c. To check such vices, public opinion
must render them infamous.<a name="FNanchor_j" id="FNanchor_j" href="#Footnote_j" class="fnanchor">[j]</a> Thoze who hav the distribution
of honors and offices, may restrain theze vices by making
the commission of them an insuperable bar to preferment.
Were the <i>Prezident</i> and the executivs of the several states, to
be az particular in enquiring whether candidates for offices
are given to gambling, swearing or debaucheries; whether they
hav ever given or receeved a challenge, or betrayed an innocent
female; az they are in enquiring whether they are men
of abilities and integrity; and would they, with undeviating
resolution, proscribe from their favor and their company, every
man whoze karacter, in theze particulars, iz not unimpeechable,
they would diminish the number of vices, exclude
some wholly from society, banish others from genteel company,
and confine their contagion to the herd of mankind. But
where iz the man of elevated rank, of great talents, of unshaken
firmness, of heroic virtue, to begin the glorious reformation?
America may now furnish the man, but where shall
hiz successor be found?</p>
